<p class="drop-capx">The manuscripts from which the principal
parts of this volume are compiled were
written by the late Mr. Hogarth; had he
lived a little longer, he would have methodized and
published them.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> On his decease, they devolved to
his widow, who kept them sacred and entire<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> until
her death, when they became the property of her
relation and executrix, Mrs. Lewis, of Chiswick, by
whose kindness and friendship they are now in my
possession.</p>

<p>This is the fair and honest pedigree of the Papers,
which may be thus divided:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. Hogarth's life, comprehending his course of
study, correspondence, political quarrels, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>II. A manuscript volume, containing the autographs
of the subscribers to his "Elections," and
intended print of "Sigismunda;" and letters to and
from Lord Grosvenor relative to that picture.</p>

<p>III. The manuscript of the <cite>Analysis of Beauty</cite>,
corrected by the author, with the original sketches,
and many remarks omitted in the printed copy.</p>

<p>IV. A supplement to the <cite>Analysis</cite>, never published;
comprising a succinct history of the arts in
his own time, his account of the institution of the
Royal Academy, etc.</p>

<p>V. Sundry memoranda relative to the subject of
his satire in several of his prints.</p>

<p>These manuscripts being written in a careless
hand, generally on loose pieces of paper, and not
paged, my first endeavour was to find the connection,
separate the subjects, and place each in its proper
class. This, in such a mass of papers, I found no
very easy task; especially as the author, when dissatisfied
with his first expression, has frequently
varied the form of the same sentence two or three
times: in such instances I have selected that which
I thought best constructed. Every paper has been
attentively examined, and is to the best of my
judgment arranged as the author intended. I have
incorporated Hogarth's account of the Arts, Academy,
etc., with his narrative of his own life; and to keep
distinct the various subjects on which he treats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
divided the whole into chapters. Where from negligence
or haste he has omitted a word, I have supplied
it with that which the context leads me to believe he
would have used. Where the sentences have been
very long, I have occasionally broken them into
shorter paragraphs, and sometimes tried to render
the style more perspicuous, by the retrenchment of
redundant expressions; but in every case the sense
of the author is faithfully adhered to.</p>

<p>As he has usually given the progress of his life,
opinions, etc. in the first person, I have adopted the
same rule; and to distinguish my own remarks from
Hogarth's narrative, the beginning of each sentence
written by him is marked with inverted commas.
His correspondence is regulated by the dates of the
letters; and the copies from sketches in the <span class="fs80">MS.</span>
<cite>Analysis</cite> are placed in the chapter which contains
Hogarth's account of that publication.</p>

<p>In the papers which relate to the subject of his
satire in some of his prints, he appears to have projected
more than his life allowed him to perform;
the few remarks which he made are inserted in the
Appendix.</p>

<p>Prints are in general designed to illustrate books,
but the Editor's part of this volume is written to
illustrate Prints. He is apprehensive that the whole
will stand in need of much indulgence, but certain
that the errors, whatever they may be, do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
originate in a want of diligence. To his thanks for
the flattering reception of the first Edition, and rapid
sale of the first and second Editions of the two
preceding volumes, he has only to add his reasons
for bringing forward this third. When they were
published, he had neither seen the <span class="fs80">MSS.</span>, nor ever
heard that Hogarth had written anything for the
press, except the <cite>Analysis of Beauty</cite>. When he
some time after obtained the papers, he considered
them as a very valuable acquisition, and was vain
enough to think that by arranging them he could
compile a volume which would gratify the admirers
of Hogarth; and in the hope that the life, opinions,
criticisms, and correspondence of this great and
original genius will excite and gratify curiosity, he
respectfully submits the following pages to the
candour and indulgence of the public.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/dc_001.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capy">Mr. Walpole (in p. 160 of his <cite>Anecdotes</cite>)
gravely declares that Hogarth had but
slender merit as a painter, and in colouring
proved no greater a master. By the six pictures
of "Marriage à la Mode," both these declarations are
answered and refuted.</p>

<p>Mr. Nichols (in p. 449 of his <cite>Anecdotes</cite>), at the
same time that he kindly acknowledges "Hogarth's
hand was faithful to character," roundly asserts that
as an engraver his merits are inconsiderable; that he
wants clearness; that his strokes sometimes look as
if fortuitously disposed, and sometimes thwart each
other in almost every possible direction. He adds,
"that what the artist wanted in skill, he strove to
make up in labour; but the result of it was a universal
haze and indistinctness, that, by excluding
force and transparency, rendered several of his larger
plates less captivating than they would have been
had he entrusted the sole execution of them to either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Ravenet or Sullivan." This is very severe; but is it
true? If the "Harlot's" and "Rake's Progress,"
the "Enraged Musician," "Strolling Actresses,"
"Medley," and many other prints produced by his
own graver, are attentively examined, I think the
strokes will not be found to be fortuitously disposed:
every touch tells, and gives that expression which the
artist intended. As to his striving to make up for
his want of skill by labour, I believe him to have
been a prodigy of industry, but do not discover the
result that is suggested by Mr. Nichols. We may
possibly annex different ideas to the words. Johnson
describes a universal <em>haze</em> as a fog, a mist; and <em>indistinctness</em>
he defines to be confusion, uncertainty,
obscurity,&mdash;faults which were never attributed to
William Hogarth. Neither have I before heard it
said that his prints want force: energy is in general
their leading characteristic. As to transparency, if
Mr. Nichols means that they have not that gauzy,
glittering tone which marks many of our modern
productions, I humbly conceive the artist did not
desire such distinction; neither did he wish his works
to be classed with such <em>pretty performances</em>: he was
superior to the tricks of art, rejected all unnecessary
flourish, and aimed at convincing the mind rather
than dazzling the eye.</p>

<p>The two most difficult things in painting are
character and drawing; and they are least under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>stood
by the crowd, who are invariably attracted by
colour and glare. But for my own part, so far am I
from thinking his style unsuitable to his subject, that
I cannot conceive any manner in which his prints
could be engraved that would be equal to his own.
I prefer it to the most laboured copies of those
miniature masters who, by fine finishing, fritter away
all force.</p>

<p>Thus much may suffice for Mr. Nichols, from
whom I am sorry to differ, as I owe him thanks for
much useful information; but with the next critic
upon the list it is dangerous to disagree.</p>

<p>For the talents of Mr. James Barry, Professor of
Painting to the Royal Academy, I have the highest
respect; his pictures in the Adelphi are an honour
to the artist, and to the nation. In the sixth,
representing the state of final retribution, he gives
Hogarth a seat in Elysium; but in p. 162 of his
description of the picture, etc. (published for Cadell),
he has drawn this great artist in so motley a garb as
leaves the reader in some doubt whether censure or
praise predominates, and confers on poor Hogarth a
sort of degrading immortality.</p>

<p>The Professor begins by admitting that "Hogarth's
merit entitles him to an honourable place amongst
the artists in Elysium, and that his little compositions
'tell' their own story with more facility than
is often found in the elevated and more noble inven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>tions
of Raphael;" yet adds, "it must be honestly
confessed that in what is called knowledge of the
figure, foreigners have justly observed Hogarth is
often so raw and unformed as hardly to deserve the
name of an artist." Though he is often thus raw
and unformed, yet Mr. Barry acknowledges that
"this capital defect is not often perceivable, as
examples of the naked and of elevated nature but
rarely occur in his subjects, which are for the most
part filled with characters that in their nature tend
to deformity." Sometimes, I admit; but surely not
for the most part. "Besides, his figures are small,
and the junctures and other difficulties of drawing
that might occur in their limbs are artfully concealed
with their clothes, rags, etc." Mr. Barry surely does
not mean that Hogarth needed any artifice to conceal
an ignorance of anatomy, because Mr. Barry knows
that many of his works prove a perfect knowledge
of the figure. The Professor thus continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What would atone for all his defects, even if they
were twice told, is his admirable fund of invention,
ever inexhaustible in its resources; and his satire,
which is always sharp and pertinent, and often highly
moral, was (except in a few instances, where he
weakly and meanly suffered his integrity to give
way to his envy) seldom or never employed in a
dishonest or unmanly way." A few instances! I do
not believe it possible to point out one. Seldom or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
never! Why is the Professor so parsimonious in his
praise? He might safely have said never. It has
been the fashion to call Hogarth an envious man;
I cannot conjecture why. The critic surely does not
mean to insinuate that there was any violation of
integrity in Hogarth's retaliating the pictured shapes
upon Wilkes and Churchill, or that he envied the
character of the late worthy Chamberlain of the city
of London!</p>

<p>Mr. Barry goes on: "Few have attempted to rival
him in his moral walk. The line of art pursued by
my very ingenious predecessor and brother Academician,
Mr. Penny, is quite distinct from that of
Hogarth, and is of a much more delicate and
superior relish; he attempts the heart, and reaches
it, whilst Hogarth's general aim is only to shake
the sides." Whoever will turn over a portfolio of
Hogarth's prints, will find that his satire had sometimes
a higher aim. "In other respects no comparison
can be thought of,"&mdash;in good truth, it cannot,&mdash;"as
Mr. Penny has all that knowledge of the figure and
academical skill which the other wanted." Can Mr.
Barry conceive it possible that posterity will think
Mr. Penny's line of art of a superior relish to that of
Hogarth! Mr. Penny's academical skill I do not
contest; but to say that Hogarth wanted all that
knowledge of the figure, etc., is rather too much. I
know that imperfections may be pointed out in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of his works, but they had their origin in carelessness
rather than ignorance.</p>

<p>Mr. Barry concludes by remarking, that "perhaps
it may be reasonably doubted whether the being
much conversant with Hogarth's method of exposing
meanness, deformity, and vice, in many of his works,
is not rather a dangerous, or at least a worthless pursuit;
which, if it does not find a false relish, and a
love of, and search after, satire and buffoonery in the
spectator, is at least not unlikely to give him one."</p>

<p>That the Professor of Painting, after acknowledging
Hogarth's satire was highly moral, should be apprehensive
that contemplating such of his works as expose
meanness, deformity, and vice, is dangerous, I
cannot comprehend!</p>

<p>Considering their genius, general good tendency,
and boundless variety, it would have been more candid
to have viewed them through the medium of his
beauties, than thus have distorted his faults, and reluctantly
admitted his merits; but to such criticism
his own works supply a short answer.</p>

<p>An instance of this occurred in 1762, when the
author of the <cite>North Briton</cite>, among some other malign
remarks, inserted the following paragraph:&mdash;"I have
for some time observed Hogarth's setting sun: he has
long been very dim, and almost shorn of his beams."
A few weeks after the appearance of this candid
critique, Hogarth published his "Medley," which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
considered in the first and second state, has more
mind, and is marked with deeper satire, than all his
other works!</p>

<p>By fastidious connoisseurs it has been said that his
scenes are sometimes low and vulgar; but he carried
into every subject the energy of genius, and marked
every countenance with the emotions of the soul.
He had powers more than equal to ascending into a
higher region, though, as he might have lost in utility
what he gained in dignity, this adherence to terrestrial
objects is not much to be regretted. Had he wandered
in heathen mythology, and chosen to people
his canvas with demigods instead of the "Harlot's
Progress," we might have had the "Loves of Venus
and Adonis;" and in the place of the "Stages of
Cruelty," the "Labours of Hercules."</p>

<p>To enumerate the little critics that stepped forth
with the <em>kind</em> intention of unpluming this "eagle
tow'ring in his pride of place," would be waste of ink;
had they succeeded to their wish, not a feather would
have been left in his wing. As an artist, he might
have soared superior to their efforts; but when he
commenced author, they found him within their reach,
and renewed their attack with redoubled acrimony.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilkes, in the <cite>North Briton</cite> above quoted, calls
him the supposed author of the <cite>Analysis</cite>. By some
he was said to have borrowed a part of the work, and
by others to have stolen the whole; nay, I have more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
than once been seriously assured that every line was
written by his friends. To this I can now reply in a
style similar to that of the peripatetic, who, being told
by a philosopher that there was no such thing as
motion, gravely rose from his seat and walked across
the room. I can produce the original manuscript,
with the red chalk corrections by his own hand.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
This supplement to that work, Hogarth wrote to vindicate
himself from these and similar aspersions. In
explaining his motives, he is led into stating his professional
opinions; and in that part which relates to
the Royal Academy, predicts that, on the plan they
set out, the institution could never be of material use
to the Arts. For one who is neither artist, associate,
nor academician, to assert that Hogarth's prophecy is
fulfilled, might be deemed too assuming. But, with
little more claim to connoisseurship than I derive from
a long and unreserved intimacy with some of the first
painters of this country, I am led to fear that the wish
their late President expressed in his first discourse is
not likely to be speedily realized. He hopes that
"the present age may vie in Arts with that of Leo the
Tenth; and that 'the dignity of the dying Art' (to
make use of an expression of Pliny) may be revived
under the reign of George the Third."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>This discourse was read in 1769; yet (let it not be
told in Gath, nor whispered in the streets of Askelon),
when in 1797 the students of the Royal Academy
produced their drawings for the silver medal, not one
of them was found worthy of the prize; and what
(considering the recent discovery of the Venetian
secret) was still more strange, all the pictures sent by
the candidates for the prize of painting were rejected,
and voted out of the room! This circumstance the
Professor of Painting has recorded in his letter to
the Dilettanti Society, and candidly admits that the
fault does not lie with the students, but is in the
Institution!</p>

<p>If it should be thought that Hogarth, in the course
of his narration, seems too tremblingly alive, and
sometimes offended where offence was not meant, let
it be recollected that he must have felt superior to
men whom the public preferred. To rank him with
Kent, Jervas, Highmore, Hudson, Hayman, or any of
that school of mannerists who figured in the different
periods of his life, is classing a giant among pigmies.
His works will bear the relative test of times when
the Arts may be higher than they were then or are
now; and I am fully conscious that this Memoir
must derive its principal interest from the celebrity of
the artist, who, like Louis de Camoëns, was a distinguished
actor in the scenes he describes.</p>

attempting the following brief history; in which must
necessarily be introduced my opinion of the present
state of the arts, and conduct of contemporary artists,
and a vindication of myself and my productions
from the aspersions which they have so liberally
bestowed upon each.</p>

<p>"With respect to my life,&mdash;to begin sufficiently
early,&mdash;I was born in the city of London, on the
10th day of November 1697, and baptized the 28th
of the same month. My father's pen, like that of
many other authors, did not enable him to do more
than put me in a way of shifting for myself. As I
had naturally a good eye and a fondness for drawing,
shows of all sorts gave me uncommon pleasure when
an infant; and mimicry, common to all children,
was remarkable in me. An early access to a neighbouring
painter drew my attention from play, and I
was at every possible opportunity employed in
making drawings. I picked up an acquaintance of
the same turn, and soon learnt to draw the alphabet
with great correctness. My exercises when at school
were more remarkable for the ornaments which
adorned them, than for the exercise itself.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In the
former I soon found that blockheads with better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
memories could much surpass me, but for the latter
I was particularly distinguished.</p>

<p>"Besides the natural turn I had for drawing rather
than learning languages, I had before my eyes the
precarious situation of men of classical education. I
saw the difficulties under which my father laboured,
and the many inconveniences he endured from his
dependence being chiefly on his pen, and the cruel
treatment he met with from booksellers and printers,
particularly in the affair of a <em>Latin Dictionary</em>,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the
compiling of which had been a work of some years.
It was deposited in confidence in the hands of a
certain printer; and during the time it was left,
letters of approbation were received from the greatest
scholars in England, Scotland, and Ireland. But
these flattering testimonies from his acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
(who, as appears from their letters which I have still
by me, were of the first class) produced no profit to
the author.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It was therefore very conformable to my
own wishes that I was taken from school and served
a long apprenticeship to a silver-plate engraver.</p>

<p>"I soon found this business in every respect too
limited. The paintings of St. Paul's Cathedral and
Greenwich Hospital,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> which were at that time going
on, ran in my head, and I determined that silver-plate
engraving should be followed no longer than
necessity obliged me to it. Engraving on copper
was, at twenty years of age, my utmost ambition.
To attain this it was necessary that I should learn
to draw objects something like nature instead of the
monsters of heraldry; and the common methods of
study were much too tedious for one who loved his
pleasure and came so late to it, for the time necessary
to learn in the usual mode would leave me none to
spare for the ordinary enjoyments of life. This led
me to considering whether a shorter road than that
usually travelled was not to be found. The early
part of my life had been employed in a business
rather detrimental than advantageous to those
branches of the art which I wished to pursue, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>have since professed. I had learned by practice to
copy with tolerable exactness in the usual way, but
it occurred to me that there were many disadvantages
attending this method of study, as having
faulty originals, etc.; and even when the pictures or
prints to be imitated were by the best masters, it
was little more than pouring water out of one vessel
into another. Drawing in an academy, though it
should be after the life, will not make the student
an artist; for as the eye is often taken from the
original to draw a bit at a time, it is possible he
may know no more of what he has been copying
when his work is finished than he did before it was
begun.</p>

<p>"There may be, and I believe are, some who, like
the engrossers of deeds, copy every line without
remembering a word; and if the deed should be in
law Latin or old French, probably without understanding
a word of their original,&mdash;happy is it for
them, for to retain would be indeed dreadful.</p>

<p>"A dull transcriber who, in copying Milton's
<cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, hath not omitted a line, has almost
as much right to be compared to Milton as an exact
copier of a fine picture by Rubens hath to be compared
to Rubens. In both cases the hand is employed
about minute parts, but the mind scarcely
ever embraces the whole. Besides this, there is an
essential difference between the man who transcribes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the deed and he who copies the figure; for though
what is written may be line for line the same with
the original, it is not probable that this will often be
the case with the copied figure: frequently far from
it. Yet the performer will be much more likely to
retain a recollection of his own imperfect work than
of the original from which he took it.</p>

<p>"More reasons, not necessary to enumerate, struck
me as strong objections to this practice, and led me
to wish that I could find the shorter path; fix forms
and characters in my mind, and, instead of copying
the lines, try to read the language, and, if possible,
find the grammar of the art, by bringing into one
focus the various observations I had made, and then
trying by my power on the canvas how far my plan
enabled me to combine and apply them to practice.</p>

<p>"For this purpose I considered what various ways,
and to what different purposes, the memory might be
applied, and fell upon one which I found most suitable
to my situation and idle disposition.</p>

<p>"Laying it down first as an axiom, that he who
could by any means acquire and retain in his memory
perfect ideas of the subjects he meant to draw, would
have as clear a knowledge of the figure as a man
who can write freely hath of the twenty-four letters
of the alphabet and their infinite combinations (each
of these being composed of lines), and would consequently
be an accurate designer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"This I thought my only chance for eminence, as
I found that the beauty and delicacy of the stroke in
engraving was not to be learnt without much practice,
and demanded a larger portion of patience than
I felt myself disposed to exercise. Added to this, I
saw little probability of acquiring the full command
of the graver in a sufficient degree to distinguish
myself in that walk; nor was I, at twenty years of
age, much disposed to enter on so barren and unprofitable
a study as that of merely making fine
lines. I thought it still more unlikely, that by pursuing
the common method and copying old drawings,
I could ever attain the power of making new designs,
which was my first and greatest ambition. I therefore
endeavoured to habituate myself to the exercise
of a sort of technical memory; and by repeating in
my own mind the parts of which objects were composed,
I could by degrees combine and put them
down with my pencil. Thus, with all the drawbacks
which resulted from the circumstances I have mentioned,
I had one material advantage over my competitors,
viz. the early habit I thus acquired of
retaining in my mind's eye, without coldly copying
it on the spot, whatever I intended to imitate.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Sometimes, but too seldom, I took the life for
correcting the parts I had not perfectly enough
remembered, and then I transferred them to my
compositions.</p>

<p>"My pleasures and my studies thus going hand
in hand, the most striking objects that presented
themselves, either comic or tragic, made the strongest
impression on my mind; but had not I sedulously
practised what I had thus acquired, I should very
soon have lost the power of performing it.</p>

<p>"Instead of burdening the memory with musty
rules, or tiring the eyes with copying dry and
damaged pictures, I have ever found studying from
nature the shortest and safest way of attaining knowledge
in my art.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> By adopting this method I found
a redundancy of matter continually occurring. A
choice of composition was the next thing to be considered,
and my constitutional idleness<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> naturally
led me to the use of such materials as I had previously
collected; and to this I was further induced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>by thinking that, if properly combined, they might
be made the most useful to society, in painting,
although similar subjects had often failed in writing
and preaching.</p>

<p>"To return to my narrative: the instant I became
master of my own time, I determined to qualify
myself for engraving on copper. In this I readily
got employment; and frontispieces to books, such as
prints to <cite>Hudibras</cite>, in twelves, etc., soon brought me
into the way. But the tribe of booksellers remained
as my father had left them when he died about five
years before this time,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> which was of an illness occasioned
partly by the treatment he met with from this
set of people, and partly by disappointment from
great men's promises; so that I doubly felt this
usage, which put me upon publishing on my own
account. But here again I had to encounter a monopoly
of printsellers equally mean and destructive to
the ingenious; for the first plate I published, called
the 'Taste of the Town,' in which the reigning
follies were lashed, had no sooner begun to take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
run, than I found copies of it in the print-shops,
vending at half price, while the original prints were
returned to me again; and I was thus obliged to
sell the plate for whatever these pirates pleased to
give me, as there was no place of sale but at their
shops.</p>

<p>"Owing to this and other circumstances, by engraving,
until I was near thirty, I could do little
more than maintain myself; but even then I was a
punctual paymaster."</p></div>

<p>The print here alluded to, I apprehend to be that
now entitled the "Small Masquerade Ticket," or
"Burlington Gate," published in 1724, in which the
follies of the town are very severely satirized by
the representation of multitudes, properly habited,
crowding to the masquerade,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> opera, pantomime
of <cite>Doctor Faustus</cite>, etc., while the works of our
greatest dramatic writers are trundled through the
streets in a wheel-barrow, and cried as waste paper
for shops.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p>As a further illustration of the taste of the times,
the artist has given a view of Burlington Gate, with
a figure, I believe, intended to represent the then
fashionable artist, William Kent, on the summit,
brandishing his palette and pencils, and placed in a
more elevated situation than either Michael Angelo
or Raphael, who, seated beneath, become the two
supporters to this favourite of Lord Burlington.</p>

<p>To this popular artist, architect, and improver of
gardens, Hogarth seems to have had an early dislike,
founded in some degree on his being, as he really
was, a most contemptible painter; and probably
heightened by his ranking higher, with those who led
the fashion of the day, than that very superior artist,
Sir James Thornhill.</p>

<p>Hogarth the year following published his</p>

<p class="noindent">which, combined with the inscription engraved beneath,
is a very bitter satire on the painter; though
it must be acknowledged that the original, which
has been for many years in the vestry-room of
St. Clement Danes, amply justifies the ridicule.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>This picture produced a small tract, with the
following title:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A letter from a parishioner of St. Clement
Danes, to Edmund (Gibson), Lord Bishop of London,
occasioned by his Lordship's causing the picture over
the altar to be taken down, with some observations
on the use and abuse of church paintings in general,
and of that picture in particular."</p>

<p>In this tract, after some compliments to the prelate,
the writer works himself into a violent rage at
the introduction of this piece of popish foppery, and
asks some questions which in a degree elucidate part
of the inscription under Hogarth's copy:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To what end or purpose was it put there, but to
affront our most gracious sovereign, by placing at our
very altar the known resemblance of a person who
is the wife of his utter enemy, and pensioner to the
whore of Babylon?</p>

<p>"When I say the known resemblance, I speak not
only according to my own knowledge, but appeal to
all mankind who have seen the Princess Sobieski, or
any picture or resemblance of her, if the picture of
that angel in the white garment and blue mantle,
which is there supposed to be beating time to the
music, is not directly a great likeness of that princess.</p>

<p>"Whether it was done by chance or on purpose, I
shall not determine; but be it which it will, it has
given great offence, and your Lordship has acted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>the part of a wise and good prelate to order its
removal."</p>

<p>It was probably during the time of Hogarth's
apprenticeship that he engraved the annexed print,
entitled</p>

</div>

<p>I by no means think, as Mr. Nichols asserts, that
this is one of the poorest of Hogarth's performances;
for though slight, and not intended to be impressed
on paper, the air of the figures is easy, and the faces,
especially those of Sir Plume and the heroine of the
story, extremely characteristic. It is said to have
been engraven on the lid of a snuff-box for some
gentleman characterized in Pope's admirable mock-heroic
poem, probably Lord Petre, who is here
represented as holding the lock of hair in his left
hand. Sir Plume,&mdash;the round-faced and insignificant
Sir Plume,&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">for Sir George Brown, who was the only one of the
party that took the thing serious. He was angry
that the poet should make him talk nothing but
nonsense; and, in truth (as Mr. Warburton adds),
one could not well blame him.</p>

<p>As this little story was intended to be viewed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
gold, the figures in the copy are not reversed, but
left as they were originally engraven on the box;
from which I believe there are only three impressions
extant, one of which was sold by Greenwood at
Mr. Gulston's sale, on the 7th of February 1786, for
£33.</p>

<p>The following account of the persons for whom
Hogarth painted several of his early pictures is
copied from his own handwriting, and may sometimes
be useful in tracing the pedigree of a portrait.</p>

<p>By this list, it appears that the two pictures of
"Before and After" were painted for a Mr. Thomson;
but as it is not probable that Hogarth delineated this
subject twice, I think that these two pictures were
the property of the late Lord Besborough. They
were sold on his Lordship's demise, in February 1801,
at Christie's rooms.</p>

<p>With this his memorandum ends; and I regret
that he has not recorded the prices he received for
the pictures. Mr. Nichols conjectures that they
were originally very low; he is most probably right
with respect to those that were painted in the early
part of Hogarth's life. But let it be recollected that
for the portrait of Garrick in Richard <span class="fs80">III.</span> he received
two hundred pounds, which, as the artist himself
remarks, was a more liberal remuneration than had
been paid to any contemporary painter. When my
late friend Mr. Gainsborough began to paint portraits
at Bath (at a period when much higher prices
were paid), his general rule was five guineas for a
three-quarters portrait.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Below is inserted a copy from one of Hogarth's
early engravings, the arms of the Duchess of Kendal,
mistress to George <span class="fs80">I.</span>, probably done on a piece of
plate at the time he was Gamble's apprentice. The
original, of the same size, is in the Editor's possession.
It is drawn in a correct and spirited style; and considering
the age of the artist, and the purpose for
which it was engraven, not demanding much attention
or exertion, gave some promise of the excellence
which he afterwards attained.</p>

<p>In this point of view, to an admirer of Hogarth it
becomes in some degree interesting, which will, I
hope, plead my apology for the insertion of this
solitary specimen of his boyish heraldry. On no
other ground should so insignificant a production as
a coat of arms have found a place in this volume.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="drop-capx">"I then married, and commenced painter of
small conversation pieces, from twelve to
fifteen inches high. This having novelty,
succeeded for a few years. But though it gave
somewhat more scope to the fancy, was still but a
less kind of drudgery; and as I could not bring
myself to act like some of my brethren, and make it
a sort of a manufactory to be carried on by the help
of background and drapery painters, it was not
sufficiently profitable to pay the expenses my family
required. I therefore turned my thoughts to a still
more novel mode, viz. painting and engraving modern
moral subjects, a field not broken up in any country
or any age.</p>

<p>"The reasons which induced me to adopt this mode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of designing were, that I thought both writers and
painters had, in the historical style, totally overlooked
that intermediate species of subjects which may be
placed between the sublime and grotesque; I therefore
wished to compose pictures on canvas, similar to
representations on the stage, and further hope that
they will be tried by the same test, and criticised by
the same criterion. Let it be observed, that I mean
to speak only of those scenes where the human species
are actors, and these I think have not often been
delineated in a way of which they are worthy and
capable.</p>

<p>"In these compositions, those subjects that will
both entertain and improve the mind bid fair to be
of the greatest public utility, and must therefore be
entitled to rank in the highest class. If the execution
is difficult (though that is but a secondary merit), the
author has a claim to a higher degree of praise. If this
be admitted, comedy in painting as well as writing
ought to be allotted the first place, as most capable
of all these perfections, though the sublime, as it is
called, has been opposed to it. Ocular demonstration
will carry more conviction to the mind of a sensible
man, than all he would find in a thousand volumes;
and this has been attempted in the prints I have composed.
Let the decision be left to every unprejudiced
eye; let the figures in either pictures or prints be
considered as players dressed either for the sublime,&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
genteel comedy,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> or farce,&mdash;for high or low life. I
have endeavoured to treat my subjects as a dramatic
writer: my picture is my stage, and men and women
my players, who by means of certain actions and
gestures are to exhibit a dumb show.</p>

<p>"Before I had done anything of much consequence
in this walk, I entertained some hopes of succeeding
in what the puffers in books call the great style of
history painting; so that without having had a stroke
of this grand business before, I quitted small portraits
and familiar conversations, and with a smile at my
own temerity, commenced history painter, and on a
great staircase at St. Bartholomew's Hospital painted
two Scripture stories (the 'Pool of Bethesda' and
the 'Good Samaritan'), with figures seven feet high.
These I presented to the charity,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and thought they
might serve as a specimen to show that were there
an inclination in England for encouraging historical
pictures, such a first essay might prove the painting
them more easily attainable than is generally imagined.
But as religion, the great promoter of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>style in other countries, rejected it in England, I was
unwilling to sink into a portrait manufacturer; and,
still ambitious of being singular, dropped all expectations
of advantage from that source, and returned to
the pursuit of my former dealings with the public at
large. This I found was most likely to answer my
purpose, provided I could strike the passions, and by
small sums from many, by the sale of prints which I
could engrave from my own pictures, thus secure my
property to myself.</p>

<p>"In pursuing my studies, I made all possible use of
the technical memory which I have before described,
by observing and endeavouring to retain in my mind
lineally such objects as best suited my purpose; so
that be where I would, while my eyes were open, I
was at my studies, and acquiring something useful
to my profession. By this means, whatever I saw,
whether a remarkable incident or a trifling subject,
became more truly a picture than one that was drawn
by a camera-obscura. And thus the most striking
objects, whether of beauty or deformity, were by
habit the most easily impressed and retained in my
imagination. A redundancy of matter being by this
means acquired, it is natural to suppose I introduced
it into my works on every occasion that I could.</p>

<p>"By this idle way of proceeding I grew so profane
as to admire nature beyond the first productions of
art, and acknowledged I saw, or fancied, delicacies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the life so far surpassing the utmost efforts of imitation,
that when I drew the comparison in my mind,
I could not help uttering blasphemous expressions
against the divinity even of Raphael Urbino, Correggio,
and Michael Angelo. For this, though my
brethren have most unmercifully abused me, I hope
to be forgiven. I confess to have frequently said, that
I thought the style of painting which I had adopted,
admitting that <em>my</em> powers were not equal to doing it
justice, might one time or other come into better
hands, and be made more entertaining and more useful
than the eternal blazonry and tedious repetition
of hackneyed, beaten subjects, either from the Scriptures
or the old ridiculous stories of heathen gods;
as neither the religion of one or the other requires
promoting among Protestants, as it formerly did in
Greece, and at a later period in Rome.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>"For these and other heretical opinions, as I have
before observed, I was deemed vain, and accused of
enviously attempting what I was unable to execute.</p>

<p>"The chief things that have brought much obloquy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
on me are: First, the attempting portrait-painting;
Secondly, writing the <cite>Analysis of Beauty</cite>; Thirdly,
painting the picture of 'Sigismunda;' and, Fourthly,
publishing the first print of 'The Times.'</p>

<p>"In the ensuing pages it shall be my endeavour to
vindicate myself from these aspersions, and each of
the subjects taken in the order they occurred shall be
occasionally interspersed with some thoughts by the
way on the state of the arts, institution of a Royal
Academy, Society of Arts, etc., as being remotely, if
not immediately, connected with my own pursuits.</p>

<p>"Though small whole lengths and prints of familiar
conversations were my principal pursuit, yet by those
who were partial to me I was sometimes employed to
paint portraits as large as life, and for this I was most
barbarously abused. My opponents acknowledged,
that in the particular branches to which I had devoted
my attention I had some little merit; but as neither
history nor portrait were my province, nothing but
what they were pleased to term extreme vanity could
induce me to attempt either one or the other; for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
would be interfering in that branch of which I had
no knowledge, and in which I had therefore no
concern.</p>

<p>"At this I was rather piqued, and, as well as I
could, defended my conduct and explained my motives.
Some part of this defence it will be necessary
to repeat; and it will also be proper to recollect,
that after having had my plates pirated in almost all
sizes, I, in 1735, applied to Parliament for redress,
and obtained it in so liberal a manner as hath not
only answered my own purpose, but made prints a
considerable article in the commerce of this country;
there being now more business of this kind done here
than in Paris, or anywhere else, and as well.</p>

<p>"The dealers in pictures and prints found their
craft in danger by what they called a new-fangled
innovation. Their trade of living and getting fortunes
by the ingenuity of the industrious has, I
know, suffered much by my interference; and if the
detection of this band of public cheats and oppressors
of the rising artists be a crime, I confess myself most
guilty.</p>

<p>"To put this matter in a fair point of view, it will
be necessary to state the situation of the arts and
artists at this period. In doing which, I shall probably
differ from every other author, as I think the
books hitherto written on the subject have had a
tendency to confirm prejudice and error, rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
diffuse information and truth. My notions of painting
differ not only from those who have formed their
opinions from books, but from those who have taken
them upon trust.</p>

<p>"I am therefore under the necessity of submitting
to the public what may possibly be deemed peculiar
opinions, but without the least hope of bringing over
either men whose interests are concerned, or who
implicitly rely upon the authority of a tribe of picture
dealers and puny judges that delight in the
marvellous, and determine to admire what they do
not understand; but I have hope of succeeding a
little with such as dare to think for themselves, and
can believe their own eyes.</p>

<p>"As introductory to the subject, let us begin with
considering that branch of the art which is termed
<em>still life</em>&mdash;a species of painting which ought to be
held in the lowest estimation.</p>

<p>"Whatever is or can be perfectly fixed, from the
plainest to the most complicated object, from a bottle
and glass to a statue of the human figure, may be
denominated <em>still life</em>. Ship and landscape painting
ought unquestionably to come into the same class;
for if copied exactly as they chance to appear, the
painters have no occasion of judgment; yet with
those who do not consider the few talents necessary,
even this tribe sometimes pass for very capital
artists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Well painted, and finely pencilled!' are phrases
perpetually repeated by coach and sign painters.
Merely well painted or pencilled is chiefly the effect
of much practice; and we frequently see that those
who are in these particulars very excellent cannot
advance a step further.</p>

<p>"As to portrait-painting, the chief branch of the
art by which a painter can procure himself a tolerable
livelihood, and the only one by which a lover of
money can get a fortune; a man of very moderate
talents may have great success in it, as the artifice
and address of a mercer is infinitely more useful
than the abilities of a painter. By the manner in
which the present race of professors in England conduct
it, that also becomes <em>still life</em> as much as any
of the preceding. Admitting that the artist has no
further view than merely copying the figure, this
must be admitted to its full extent; for the sitter
ought to be still as a statue, and no one will dispute
a statue being as much <em>still life</em> as fruit, flowers, a
gallipot, or a broken earthen pan. It must, indeed,
be acknowledged they do not seem ashamed of the
title, for their figures are frequently so executed as
to be <em>as still as a post</em>. Posture and drapery, as it
is called, is usually supplied by a journeyman, who
puts a coat, etc. on a wooden figure like a jointed
doll, which they call a layman, and copies it in every
fold as it chances to come; and all this is done at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
so easy a rate, as enables the principal to get more
money in a week than a man of the first professional
talents can in three months. If they have a sufficient
quantity of silks, satins, and velvets to dress their
layman, they may thus carry on a very profitable
manufactory without a ray of genius. There is a
living instance well known to the connoisseurs in
this town, of one of the best copiers of pictures,
particularly those by Rubens, who is almost an
idiot.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Mere correctness, therefore, if in still life,
from an apple or a rose, to the face,&mdash;nay, even the
whole figure, if you take it merely as it presents
itself,&mdash;requires only an exact eye and an adroit hand.
Their pattern is before them, and much practice
with little study is usually sufficient to bring them
into high vogue. By perpetual attention to this
branch only, one should imagine they would attain
a certain stroke&mdash;quite the reverse; for though the
whole business lies in an oval of four inches long,
which they have before them, they are obliged to
repeat and alter the eyes, mouth, and nose, three or
four times before they can make it what they think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
right. The little praise due to their productions
ought, in most cases, to be given to the drapery-man,
whose pay is only one part in ten, while the
other nine, as well as all the reputation, is engrossed
by the master phiz-monger for a proportion which
he may complete in five or six hours; and even this,
little as it is, gives him so much importance in his
own eyes, that he assumes a consequential air, sets
his arms akimbo, and, strutting among the historical
artists, cries, 'How we apples swim!'</p>

<p>"For men who drudge in this mechanical part
merely for gain, to commence dealers in pictures is
natural. In this, also, great advantage may accrue
from the labour and ingenuity of others. They
stand in the catalogue of painters; and having little
to study in their own way, become great connoisseurs,
not in the points where real perfection lies, for there
they must be deficient, as their ideas have been confined
to the oval; but their great inquiry is, how the
old masters stand in the public estimation, that they
may regulate their prices accordingly, both in buying
and selling. You may know these painter-dealers
by their constant attendance at auctions. They
collect under pretence of a love for the arts, but
sell, knowing the reputation they have stamped on
the commodity they have once purchased, in the
opinion of the ignorant admirer of pictures, drawings,
and prints, which, thus warranted, almost in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>variably
produce them treble their original purchase
money, and treble their real worth. Unsanctioned
by their authority,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and unascertained by tradition,
the best preserved and highest finished picture
(though it should have been painted by Raphael)
will not, at a public auction, produce five shillings;
while a despicable, damaged, and repaired old canvas,
sanctioned by their praise, shall be purchased
at any price, and find a place in the noblest collections.
All this is very well understood by the
dealers, who, on every occasion where their own
interest is concerned, are wondrously loquacious in
adoring the mysterious beauties! spirited touches!
brilliant colours! and the Lord knows what, of these
ancient worn-out wonders! But whoever should dare
to hint that (admitting them to be originally painted
by Raphael) there is little left to admire in them,
would be instantly stigmatized as vilifying the great
masters, and, to invalidate his judgment, accused of
envy and self-conceit. By these misrepresentations,
if he has an independent fortune, he only suffers the
odium; but if a young man, without any other property
than his talents, presumes boldly to give an
opinion, he may be undone by his temerity; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the whole herd will unite and try to hunt him
down.</p>

<p>"Such is the situation of the arts and artists at
this time. Credulity,&mdash;an implicit confidence in the
opinions of others,&mdash;and not daring to think for
themselves, leads the whole town into error, and thus
they become the prey of ignorant and designing
knaves.</p>

<p>"With respect to portrait-painting, whatever
talents a professor may have, if he is not in fashion,
and cannot afford to hire a drapery-man, he will
not do; but if he is in vogue, and can employ a
journeyman and place a layman in the garret of his
manufactory, his fortune is made, and, as his two
coadjutors are kept in the background, his own fame
is established.</p>

<p>"If a painter comes from abroad, his being an
exotic will be much in his favour; and if he has
address enough to persuade the public that he had
brought a new discovered mode of colouring, and
paints his faces all red, all blue, or all purple, he has
nothing to do but to hire one of these painted tailors
as an assistant, for without him the manufactory
cannot go on, and my life for his success.</p>

<p>"Vanloo,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> a French portrait-painter, being told
that the English were to be cajoled by any one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
had a sufficient portion of assurance, came to this
country, set his trumpeters to work, and by the
assistance of puffing monopolized all the people of
fashion in the kingdom. Down went at once *,&mdash;*,&mdash;*,&mdash;*,&mdash;*,&mdash;
etc. etc. etc.,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> painters who before
his arrival were highly fashionable and eminent,
but by this foreign interloper were driven into the
greatest distress and poverty.</p>

<p>"By this inundation of folly and fuss, I must
confess I was much disgusted, and determined to
try if by any means I could stem the torrent, and
'by opposing end it.' I laughed at the pretensions
of these quacks in colouring, ridiculed their productions
as feeble and contemptible, and asserted that it
required neither taste nor talents to excel their most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
popular performances. This interference excited
much enmity, because, as my opponents told me,
my studies were in another way. You talk, added
they, with ineffable contempt of portrait-painting; if
it is so easy a task, why do not you convince the
world by painting a portrait yourself? Provoked at
this language, I one day at the Academy in St.
Martin's Lane put the following question: Supposing
any man at this time were to paint a portrait as well
as Vandyke, would it be seen or acknowledged, and
could the artist enjoy the benefit or acquire the
reputation due to his performance?</p>

<p>"They asked me in reply if I could paint one as
well? and I frankly answered, 'I believed I could.'<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
My query as to the credit I should obtain if I did,
was replied to by Mr. Ramsay, and confirmed by the
president and about twenty members present: 'Our
opinions must be consulted, and we will never allow
it.' Piqued at this cavalier treatment, I resolved to
try my own powers; and if I did what I attempted,
determined to affirm that <em>I had done it</em>. In this
decided manner I had a habit of speaking; and if I
only did myself justice, to have adopted half words
would have been affectation. Vanity, as I understand
it, consists in affirming you have done that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
which you have not done, not in frankly asserting
what you are convinced is truth.</p>

<p>"A watchmaker may say, 'The watch which I have
made for you is as good as Quare, or Tompion, or
any other man could have made.' If it really is so,
he is neither called vain nor branded with infamy,
but deemed an honest and fair man for being as good
as his word. Why should not the same privilege be
allowed to a painter? The modern artist, though he
will not warrant his works as the watchmaker, has
the impudence to demand twice as much money for
painting them as was charged by those whom he
acknowledges his superiors in the art.</p>

<p>"Of the mighty talents said to be requisite for
portrait-painting I had not the most exalted opinion,
and thought that, if I chose to practise in this branch,
I could at least equal my contemporaries, for whose
glittering productions I really had not much reverence.
In answer to this there are who will say with
Peachum in the play, 'All professions be-rogue one
another;' but let it be taken into the account that
men with the same pursuits are naturally rivals,
and when put in competition with each other must
necessarily be so,&mdash;what racer ever wished that his
opponent might outrun him? what boxer ever chose
to be beat in pure complaisance to his antagonist?
The artist who pretends to be pleased and gratified
when he sees himself excelled by his competitor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
must have lost all reverence for truth, or be totally
dead to that spirit which I believe to be one great
source of excellence in all human attempts; and if
he is so polite and civil as to confess superiority in
one he knows to be his inferior, he must be either a
fool or an hypocrite, perhaps both. If he has temper
enough to be silent, it is surely sufficient; but this
I have seldom seen, even amongst the most complaisant
and liberal of the faculty.</p>

<p>"Those who will honestly speak their feelings must
confess that all this is natural to man. One of the
highest gratifications of superiority arises from the
pleasure which attends instructing men who do not
know so much as ourselves; but when they verge on
being rivals, the pleasure in a degree ceases. Hence
the story of Rubens advising Vandyke to paint horses
and faces, to prevent, as it is said, his being put in
competition with himself in history-painting. Had
either of these great artists lived in England at this
time, they would have found men of very moderate
parts&mdash;mere face painters&mdash;who, if they chanced to
be in vogue, might with ease get a thousand a year,
when they with all their talents would scarcely have
found employment.</p>

<p>"To return to my dispute with Mr. Ramsay on the
abilities necessary for portrait-painting: as I found
the performances of professors in this branch of the
art were held in such estimation, I determined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
have a brush at it. I had occasionally painted
portraits; but as they required constant practice to
take a likeness with facility, and the life must not be
rigidly followed, my portraitures met with a fate
somewhat similar to those of Rembrandt. By some
they were said to be nature itself, by others declared
most execrable; so that time only can decide whether
I was the best or the worst face painter of my day,
for a medium was never so much as suggested.</p>

<p>"The portrait which I painted with most pleasure,
and in which I particularly wished to excel, was that
of Captain Coram, for the Foundling Hospital; and
if I am so wretched an artist as my enemies assert, it
is somewhat strange that this, which was one of the
first I painted the size of life, should stand the test of
twenty years' competition, and be generally thought
the best portrait in the place, notwithstanding the
first painters in the kingdom exerted all their talents
to vie with it.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> To this I refer Mr. <em>Rams-eye</em><a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and
his quick-sighted and impartial coadjutors."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<p class="p2" />
<h4>CAPTAIN THOMAS CORAM</h4>

<p class="noindent">was born in the year 1668, bred to the sea, and
passed the first part of his life as master of a vessel
trading to the colonies. While he resided in the
vicinity of Rotherhithe, his avocations obliging him
to go early into the city and return late, he frequently
saw deserted infants exposed to the inclemencies of
the seasons, and through the indigence or cruelty of
their parents left to casual relief or untimely death.
This naturally excited his compassion, and led him to
project the establishment of an hospital for the reception
of exposed and deserted young children; in
which humane design he laboured more than seventeen
years, and at last, by his unwearied application,
obtained the Royal Charter, bearing date the 17th of
October 1739, for its incorporation.</p>

<p>He was highly instrumental in promoting another
good design, viz. the procuring a bounty upon naval
stores imported from the colonies to Georgia and
Nova Scotia. But the charitable plan which he lived
to make some progress in, though not to complete,
was a scheme for uniting the Indians in North
America more closely with the British Government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
by an establishment for the education of Indian girls.
Indeed, he spent a great part of his life in serving the
public, and with so total a disregard to his private
interest, that in his old age he was himself supported
by a pension of somewhat more than an hundred
pounds a year,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> raised for him at the solicitation of
Sir Sampson Gideon and Dr. Brocklesby, by the
voluntary subscriptions of public-spirited persons, at
the head of whom was the late Frederick Prince of
Wales. On application being made to this venerable
and good old man to know whether a subscription
being opened for his benefit would not offend
him, he gave this noble answer: "I have not
wasted the little wealth of which I was formerly
possessed in self-indulgence or vain expenses, and
am not ashamed to confess that in this my old age I
am poor."</p>

<p>This singularly humane, persevering, and memorable
man died at his lodgings near Leicester Square,
March 29, 1751, and was interred, pursuant to his
own desire, in the vault under the chapel of the
Foundling Hospital, where an historic epitaph records
his virtues, as Hogarth's portrait has preserved his
honest countenance.</p>

<p>Hogarth thus resumes his narrative:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>"For the portrait of Mr. Garrick in Richard <span class="fs80">III.</span>
I was paid two hundred pounds<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> (which was more
than any English artist ever received for a single
portrait), and that, too, by the sanction of several
painters who had been previously consulted about
the price, which was not given without mature consideration.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding all this, the current remark was,
that portraits were not my province, and I was
tempted to abandon the only lucrative branch of my
art, for the practice brought the whole nest of phiz-mongers
on my back, where they buzzed like so
many hornets. All these people have their friends,
whom they incessantly teach to call my women
harlots, my 'Essay on Beauty' borrowed,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and my
composition and engraving contemptible.</p>

<p>"This so much disgusted me, that I sometimes
declared I would never paint another portrait, and
frequently refused when applied to; for I found by
mortifying experience, that whoever would succeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>in this branch must adopt the mode recommended
in one of Gay's fables, and make divinities of all who
sit to him.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Whether or not this childish affectation
will ever be done away, is a doubtful question: none
of those who have attempted to reform it have yet
succeeded; nor, unless portrait-painters in general
become more honest, and their customers less vain, is
there much reason to expect they ever will."</p></div>

<p>Though thus in a state of warfare with his brother
artists, he was occasionally gratified by the praise of
men whose judgment was universally acknowledged,
and whose sanction became an higher honour, from
its being neither lightly nor indiscriminately given.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="p2 negin2 fs80 lht">OF ACADEMIES. HOGARTH'S OPINION OF THAT NOW DENOMINATED
ROYAL; AND OF THE SOCIETY FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF
ARTS, MANUFACTURES, AND COMMERCE, GIVING PREMIUMS FOR
PICTURES AND DRAWINGS.</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/dc_054.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capx">Among Hogarth's loose papers I found the
rough draft of a letter (addressed but
not directed) to a nobleman, declaring his
disapprobation of a scheme by which certain projectors
were endeavouring to establish a Royal
Academy, and stating that he had a plan which
would be much more useful. I do not know that he
ever sent the epistle, or admitting he did, that it was
honoured with an answer. But as I think it probable
he had given the subject some consideration, with the
hope of bringing his project to bear, and that in the
following pages relative to the Royal Academy he
has stated what he meant to have said to the Peer, I
have inserted it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;Mr. Martin has informed me that
when some of my thoughts relative to the establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>ment
of a public academy are put into writing, you
will peruse them. I have made a rough sketch, but
to fit it for inspection will require much time, which it
will be needless to take till I have your Lordship's
opinion on two or three leading points on which the
whole will turn, and which I cannot with propriety
commit to paper. A verbal statement of them will
not take up more than half an hour; and if, when
known, they are not concurred in, I will not take up
your Lordship's time by arguing on their propriety.
But I am vain enough to think, that though I must
say strong, and perhaps startling things, with regard
to myself and others, I can prove every position
which I shall advance.</p>

<p>"I have reason to believe that another project is
in hand: this the author will naturally defend in opposition
to mine, but it shall not create controversy;
for being now upwards of sixty years of age, and in
a very poor state of health, I would rather lose a
favourite point than break a night's rest.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ramsey, if I judge right, is no stranger to
the plan I allude to, and I know his opinion differs
from mine, and am firmly persuaded his interest will
induce him to support it.&mdash;I am, my Lord, etc.,</p>

<p class="right">"W. H."</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Much has been said about the immense benefit
likely to result from the establishment of an academy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
in this country; but as I do not see it in the same
light with many of my contemporaries, I shall take
the freedom of making my objections to the plan on
which they propose forming it; and as a sort of preliminary
to the subject, state some slight particulars
concerning the fate of former attempts at similar
establishments.</p>

<p>"The first place of this sort was in Queen Street,
about sixty years ago; it was begun by some gentlemen-painters
of the first rank, who in their general
forms imitated the plan of that in France, but conducted
their business with far less fuss and solemnity;
yet the little that there was, in a very short time became
the object of ridicule. Jealousies arose, parties
were formed, and the president and all his adherents
found themselves comically represented as marching
in ridiculous procession round the walls of the room.
The first proprietors soon put a padlock on the door;
the rest, by their right as subscribers, did the same,
and thus ended this academy.</p>

<p>"Sir James Thornhill, at the head of one of these
parties, then set up another in a room he built at the
back of his own house,&mdash;now next the playhouse,&mdash;and
furnished tickets gratis to all that required admission;
but so few would lay themselves under such
an obligation, that this also soon sunk into insignificance.
Mr. Vanderbank headed the rebellious
party, and converted an old Presbyterian meeting-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
into an academy, with the addition of a woman
figure, to make it the more inviting to subscribers.
This lasted a few years; but the treasurer sinking the
subscription money, the lamp, stove, etc. were seized
for rent, and that also dropped.</p>

<p>"Sir James dying, I became possessed of his
neglected apparatus; and thinking that an academy
conducted on proper and moderate principles had
some use, proposed that a number of artists should
enter into a subscription for the hire of a place large
enough to admit thirty or forty people to draw after
a naked figure. This was soon agreed to, and a room
taken in St. Martin's Lane. To serve the society, I
lent them the furniture which had belonged to Sir
James Thornhill's academy; and as I attributed the
failure of that and Mr. Vanderbank's to the leading
members assuming a superiority which their fellow-students
could not brook, I proposed that every
member should contribute an equal sum to the
establishment, and have an equal right to vote in
every question relative to the society. As to electing
presidents, directors, professors, etc., I considered it
as a ridiculous imitation of the foolish parade of the
French Academy, by the establishment of which
Louis <span class="fs80">XIV.</span> got a large portion of fame and flattery
on very easy terms. But I could never learn that the
arts were benefited, or that members acquired any
other advantages than what arose to a few leaders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
from their paltry salaries, not more I am told than
£50 a year; which, as must always be the case, were
engrossed by those who had most influence, without
any regard to their relative merit.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> As a proof of
the little benefit the arts derived from this Royal
Academy, Voltaire asserts that, after its establishment,
no one work of genius appeared in the
country: the whole band, adds the same lively and
sensible writer, became mannerists and imitators.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It
may be said in answer to this, that all painting is but
imitation. Granted; but if we go no further than
copying what has been done before, without entering
into the spirit, causes, and effects, what are we doing?
If we vary from our original, we fall off from it, and
it ceases to be a copy; and if we strictly adhere to
it, we can have no hopes of getting beyond it; for
'if two men ride on a horse, one of them must be
behind.'</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>

<p>"To return to our own academy. By the regulations
I have mentioned of a general equality, etc., it
has now subsisted near thirty years, and is, to every
useful purpose, equal to that in France, or any other;
but this does not satisfy. The members, finding his
present Majesty's partiality to the arts, met at the
Turk's Head in Gerard Street, Soho, laid out the
public money in advertisements to call all sorts of
artists together, and have resolved to draw up and
present a ridiculous address to King, Lords, and
Commons to do for them what they have (as well as
it can be) done for themselves. Thus to pester the
three great estates of the empire, about twenty or
thirty students, drawing after a man or a horse,
appears, as it must be acknowledged, foolish enough;
but the real motive is, that a few bustling characters,
who have access to people of rank, think they can
thus get a superiority over their brethren, be appointed
to places, and have salaries as in France,
for telling a lad when an arm or a leg is too long
or too short.</p>

<p>"Not approving of this plan, I opposed it; and
having refused to assign to the society the property
which I had before lent them, I am accused of acrimony,
ill-nature, and spleen, and held forth as an
enemy to the arts and artists. How far their mighty
project will succeed, I neither know nor care; certain
I am it deserves to be laughed at, and laughed at it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
has been.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The business rests in the breast of
Majesty, and the simple question now is, whether
he will do what Sir James Thornhill did before him,
<em>i.e.</em> establish an academy with the little addition of
a royal name, and salaries for those professors who
can make most interest and obtain the greatest
patronage. As his Majesty's beneficence to the arts
will unquestionably induce him to do that which he
thinks most likely to promote them, would it not
be more useful if he were to furnish his own gallery
with one picture by each of the most eminent
painters among his own subjects? This might possibly
set an example to a few of the opulent nobility;
but even then it is to be feared that there never can
be a market in this country, for the great number of
works which, by encouraging parents to place their
children in this line, it would probably cause to be
painted. The world is already glutted with these
commodities, which do not perish fast enough to
want such a supply.</p>

<p>"In answer to this and other objections which I
have sometimes made to those who display so much
zeal for increasing learners, and crowding the profession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
I am asked if I consider what the arts were
in Greece, what immense benefits accrued to the city
of Rome from the possession of their works, and what
advantages the people of France derive from the
encouragement given by their Royal Academy? It
is added, why cannot we have one on the same principles?
That we may not be led away by sounds
without meaning, let us take a cursory view of these
things separately, and in the same order that they
occurred.</p>

<p>"The height to which the arts were carried in
Greece was owing to a variety of causes, concerning
some of which we can now only form conjectures.
They made a part of their system of government,
and were connected with their modes of worship.
Their temples were crowded with deities of their
own manufacture, and in places of public resort
were depicted such actions of their fellow-citizens as
deserved commemoration; which, being displayed in
a language legible to all, incited the spectator to
emulate the virtues they represented. The artists
who could perform such wonders were held in an
estimation of which we can hardly form an idea;
and could we ascertain the rewards they received,
I think it would be found that they were most
liberally paid for their works, and might therefore
devote much more time than we can afford to rendering
them perfect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"With all this, even there, the arts had but a slow
rise; and when they had attained their highest state
of perfection, the Romans (having previously plundered
and butchered their own neighbours) attacked
and conquered the Greeks, and robbed them also of
their portable treasures, particularly their statues
and pictures.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> To sculpture and painting, war is a
most destructive enemy; the rage of conquest, civil
broils, and intestine quarrels, necessarily put a stop
to the exercise of the imitative arts, which lay in a
dormant state until they were revived by the introduction
of a new religion; this, in the magnificent
style it was there brought forward, called upon sculpture
and painting for their auxiliary aid. The admirable
specimens that during the perturbed period
above alluded to had been hidden in the earth, were
now restored to light, eagerly sought for, and in some
cases appropriated to purposes diametrically opposite
to their pagan origin.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Even those that were mutilated
were held in the most enthusiastic admiration.
The 'Torso,' and many other inimitable specimens,
prove that their admiration was just. The contemplation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>of such works would naturally produce imitators,
who in time rivalled, but never could equal,
their originals. These remains of ancient grandeur
being thus added to their new productions, and both
interwoven, forming a sort of ornamental fringe to
their gaudy religion, Rome became a kind of puppet-show
to the rest of Europe; and, whatever it might
be to their visitors, was certainly very advantageous
to themselves. The arts are much indebted to
Popery, and that religion owes much of its universality
to the arts.</p>

<p>"France, ever aping the magnificence of other
nations, has in its turn assumed a foppish kind of
splendour sufficient to dazzle the eyes of neighbouring
states, and draw vast sums of money from this
country. We cannot vie with these Italian and
Gallic theatres of art, and to enter into competition
with them is ridiculous; we are a commercial people,
and can purchase their curiosities ready made, as in
fact we do, and thereby prevent their thriving in
our native clime. If I may be permitted to compare
great things with small, this nation labours under
similar disadvantage to the playhouse in Goodman's
Fields, which, though it might injure, could never
rival the two established theatres, so much more
properly situated, in any degree material to itself.</p>

<p>"In Holland, selfishness is the ruling passion; in
England, vanity is united with it. Portrait-painting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
therefore ever has, and ever will succeed better in
this country than in any other.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The demand will
be as constant as new faces arise; and with this we
must be contented, for it will be vain to attempt to
force what can never be accomplished, or at least can
never be accomplished by such institutions as Royal
Academies on the system now in agitation. Upon
the whole, it must be acknowledged that the artists
and the age are fitted for each other. If hereafter
the times alter, the arts, like water, will find their
level.</p>

<p>"Among other causes that militate against either
painting or sculpture succeeding in this nation, we
must place our religion; which, inculcating unadorned
simplicity, does not require&mdash;nay, absolutely
forbids&mdash;images for worship, or pictures to excite
enthusiasm. Paintings are considered as pieces of
furniture, and Europe is already overstocked with
the works of other ages. These, with copies countless
as the sands on the sea-shore, are bartered to
and fro, and quite sufficient for the demands of the
curious, who naturally prefer scarce, expensive, and
far-fetched productions to those which they might
have on low terms at home. Who can be expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to give forty guineas for a modern landscape, though
in ever so superior a style, when he can purchase
one which, for little more than double the sum, shall
be sanctioned by a sounding name, and warranted
original by a solemn-faced connoisseur? This considered,
can it excite wonder that the arts have not
taken such deep root in this soil as in places where
the people cultivate them from a kind of religious
necessity, and where proficients have so much more
profit in the pursuit? Whether it is to our honour or
disgrace, I will not presume to say, but the fact is
indisputable, that the public encourage trade and
mechanics rather than painting and sculpture. Is it
then reasonable to think that the artist, who, to attain
essential excellence in his profession, should have the
talents of a Shakspeare, a Milton, or a Swift, will
follow this tedious and laborious study merely for
fame, when his next-door neighbour, perhaps a porter-brewer
or an haberdasher of smallwares, can without
any genius accumulate an enormous fortune in a few
years, become a lord mayor or a member of Parliament,
and purchase a title for his heir? Surely no;
for as very few painters get even moderately rich, it
is not reasonable to expect that they should waste
their lives in cultivating the higher branch of the
art until their country becomes more alive to its
importance, and better disposed to reward their
labours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"These are the true causes that have retarded our
progress; and for this shall a nation, which has in all
ages abounded in men of sound understanding and
the brightest parts, be branded with incapacity by a
set of pedantic dreamers, who seem to imagine that
the degrees of genius are to be measured like the
degrees on a globe, determine a man's powers from
the latitude in which he was born, and think that a
painter, like certain tender plants, can only thrive in
a hothouse? Gross as are these absurdities, there
will always be a band of profound blockheads ready
to adopt and circulate them, if it were only upon the
authority of the great names by which they are
sanctioned.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>"To return to our Royal Academy. I am told
that one of their leading objects will be sending
young men abroad to study the antique statues, etc.
Such kind of studies may sometimes improve an
exalted genius, but they will not create it; and whatever
has been the cause, this same travelling to Italy
has, in several instances that I have seen, seduced the
student from nature, and led him to paint marble
figures,&mdash;in which he has availed himself of the great
works of antiquity, as a coward does when he puts
on the armour of an Alexander; for with similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
pretensions and similar vanity, the painter supposes
he shall be adored as a second Raphael Urbino.</p>

<p>"The fact is, that everything necessary for the
student in sculpture or painting may at this time
be procured in London. Of the 'Venus' and the
'Gladiator' we have small casts; and even the
'Torso,' by which Michael Angelo asserted he
learned all he knew of the art, has been copied in
a reduced size, and the cast, by which the principle
may be clearly seen, is sold for a few shillings.
These small casts, if quite correct, are full as useful
to the student as the originals; the parts are easier
comprehended, they are more portable to place in
different lights, and of an even colour, while the old
Parian marbles are apt to shine, dazzle, and confound
the eye. If this be doubted, let a plaster figure be
smoked and oiled, and the true dimensions of the
muscles can be no more distinguished than those of
a sooty chimney-sweeper.</p>

<p>"After all, though the best statues are unquestionably
in parts superlatively fine, and superior to
nature, yet they have invariably a something that is
inferior.</p>

<p>"As to pictures, there are enough in England to
seduce us from studying nature, which every man
ought to do if he aims at any higher rank than being
an imitator of the works of others; and to such
servile spirits I will offer no advice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"In one word, I think that young men by studying
in Italy have seldom learnt much more than the
names of the painters; though sometimes they have
attained the amazing power of distinguishing styles,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
and knowing by the hue of the picture the hard name
of the artist,&mdash;a power which, highly as they pride
themselves upon it, is little more than knowing one
handwriting from another. For this they gain great
credit, and are supposed vast proficients because they
have travelled. They are gravely attended to by
people of rank, with whom they claim acquaintance,
and talk of the antique in a cant phraseology made
up of half or whole Italian, to the great surprise of
their hearers, who become gulls in order to pass for
connoisseurs,&mdash;wonder with a foolish face of praise,
and bestow unqualified admiration on the marvellous
bad copies of marvellous bad originals which they
have brought home as trophies, and triumphantly
display to prove their discernment and taste.</p>

<p>"Neither England nor Italy ever produced a more
contemptible dauber than the late Mr. Kent; and
yet he gained the prize at Rome, in England had the
first people for his patrons, and, to crown the whole,
was appointed Painter to the King. But in this
country such men meet with the greatest encouragement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and soonest work their way into noblemen's
houses and palaces.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>"To conclude, I think that this ostentatious establishment
can answer no one valuable purpose to the
arts, nor be of the least use to any individual, except
those who are to be elected professors and receive
salaries for the <em>kind superintendence</em> they will exercise
over such of their brethren as have not so much
interest as themselves.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>"Many of the objections which I have to the
institution of this Royal Academy apply with equal
force to the project of the Society for the encouragement
of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, for
distributing premiums for drawings and pictures; subjects
of which they are totally ignorant, and in which
they can do no possible service to the community.</p>

<p>"It is extremely natural for noblemen, or young
people of fortune who have travelled and seen fine
pictures and statues, to be planet-struck with a desire
of being celebrated in books, like those great men of
whom they have read in the lives of the painters, etc.;
for it must be recollected that the popes, princes, and
cardinals who patronized these painters, have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>celebrated as creators of the men who created those
great works:</p>

<p class="center small">'Shar'd all their honours, and partook their fame.'</p>

<p>"The 'Dilettanti' had all this in prospect when
they offered to establish a drawing-school, etc. at
their own expense; for here they expected to be
paramount. But when those painters who projected
the scheme presumed to bear a part in the direction
of the school, the 'Dilettanti' kept their money, and
rejected them with scorn,&mdash;the whole castle fell to
the ground, and has been no more heard of.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
<p>"This society of castle-builders have a similar idea.
They wish first to persuade the world that no genius
can deserve notice without being first cultivated
under their direction, and will ultimately neither
foster nor encourage any artist that has not been
brought up by themselves.</p>

<p>"The sounding title of a society for the encouragement
of arts, manufactures, and commerce, with two
or three people of rank at their head, attracted a
multitude of subscribers. Men when repeatedly
applied to were unwilling to refuse two guineas a
year; people of leisure, tired of public amusements,
found themselves entertained with formal speeches
from men who had still more pleasure in displaying
their talents for oratory. Artificers of all descriptions
were invited, and those who were not bidden strained
every nerve to become members, and appear upon
the printed list as promoters of the fine arts. By
this means they were consulted in their several
professions, and happy was he who could assume
courage enough to speak, though ever so little to the
purpose.</p>

<p>"The intention of this great society is unquestionably
laudable; their success in subscriptions
astonishing. How far their performances have been
equal to their promises, it is not my business to
inquire; but as, while I had the honour of being a
member, my opinion was frequently asked on some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
points relating to my own profession, I venture to
lay it before the reader with the same frankness that
I then gave it.</p>

<p>"When the society was in its infancy they gave
premiums for children's drawings, and for this&mdash;'Let
children lisp their praise.'<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> It was asserted that
we should thus improve our own manufactures, and
gravely asked by these <em>professed</em> encouragers of the
commerce of their country, if the French children
being instructed in drawing did not enable that
people to give a better air to all the articles they
fabricated. I answered positively, <span class="fs80">NO</span>; and added,
that thus trumpeting their praise was a degradation
of our own country, and giving to our rivals a character
which they had no right to. Were this point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
debated, French superiority would be supported by
fashionable ladies, travelled gentlemen, and picture-dealers.
In opposition to them, would be those who
are capable of judging for themselves, the few that
are not led away by popular prejudices, and the first
artists in the kingdom. These, I am conscious,
would be a minority, but composed of men that
ought to have weight, and whose opinion and advice
should have been taken before the plan was put in
execution.</p>

<p>"Of the immense improvement that is to take
place in our manufactures from boys of almost every
profession being taught to draw, I form no very
sanguine expectations.</p>

<p>"To attain the power of imitating the forms of
letters with freedom and precision in all their due
proportions and various elegant turns, as Snell has
given them, requires as much skill as to copy different
forms of columns and cornices in architecture, and
might with some show of propriety be said to
demand a knowledge of design; yet common sense
and experience convince us that the proper place
for acquiring a fine hand is a writing-school. As
measuring is but measuring, I do not think that a
tailor would make a suit of clothes fit better from
having been employed twice seven years in taking
the dimensions of all the bits of antiquity that remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in Greece.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> How absurd would it be to see periwig-makers
and shoemakers' boys learning the art of
drawing, that they might give grace to a peruke or a
slipper! If the study of Claude's landscapes would
benefit the carver of a picture-frame, or the contemplation
of a finely-painted saucepan by Teniers
or Bassan would be an improvement to a tinman, it
would be highly proper for this society to encourage
them in the practice of the arts. But as this is not
the case, giving lads of all ranks a little knowledge
of everything is almost as absurd as it would be to
instruct shopkeepers in oratory, that they may be
thus enabled to talk people into buying their goods,
because oratory is necessary at the bar and in the
pulpit. As to giving premiums to those that design
flowers, etc. for silks and linens, let it be recollected
that these artisans copy the objects they introduce
from nature,&mdash;a much surer guide than all the
childish and ridiculous absurdities of temples, dragons,
pagodas, and other fantastic fripperies which have
been imported from China.</p>

<p>"As from all these causes (and many more might
be added) it appears that a smattering in the arts
can be of little use except to those who make painting
their sole pursuit, why should we tempt such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
multitudes to embark in a profession by which they
never can be supported? For historical pictures
there never can be a demand:<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> our churches reject
them; the nobility prefer foreign productions; and
the generality of our apartments are too small to
contain them. A certain number of portrait-painters,
if they can get patronized by people of rank, may
find employment; but the majority even of these
must either shift how they can amongst their
acquaintance, or live by travelling from town to
town like gipsies. Yet, as many will be allured by
flattering appearances, and form vague hopes of
success, some of the candidates must be unsuccessful;
and men will be rendered miserable who might have
lived comfortably enough by almost any manufactory,
and will wish that they had been taught to
make a shoe, rather than thus devoted to the polite
arts.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> When I once stated something like this to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>the society, a member <em>humanely</em> remarked, that the
poorer we kept the artists, the cheaper we might
purchase their works."</p></div>

<p>These two societies, of whose projects and practice
Hogarth seems to have entertained very similar
opinions, became for a short time so far connected,
that where one held their meetings the other exhibited
their pictures. The donations in painting
which Hogarth and several other artists had made
to the Foundling Hospital had much engaged the
public attention; and the painters finding the effects
they produced, determined to try the fate of an
exhibition of their work; in consequence of which,
on the 27th of February 1760, Mr. Hayman, then
chairman of the committee of artists, wrote a letter
to the society for encouragement of arts, requesting
permission for the painters to exhibit at their
great room opposite Beaufort Buildings in the Strand;
and in the following May they accordingly made
their first Exhibition. This proved very attractive;
and, from the money paid for admission, they were
soon enabled to relieve not only the indigent of their
own body, but also aliens; and to establish themselves
into a regular institution by the name of "A
Society of Artists, associated for the relief of the
distressed and decayed of their own body, their
widows, and children." For these humane purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
they agreed to form a fund. As far as this plan
went it had Hogarth's approbation; and for their
Exhibition Catalogue of 1761 he made two designs,
which were engraved by Mr. Charles Grignion, and
of which the following are copies:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">Erected in the cleft of a rock, we have here a
building intended for a reservoir of water; and by
the bust of his present Majesty being placed in a
niche of an arch, which is lined with a shell and surmounted
by a crown, we must suppose it a royal
reservoir. The mouth of a mask of the British lion
is made the water-spout for conveying a stream into
a garden-pot, which a figure of Britannia holds in
her right hand, and, with her spear in the left, is
employed in sprinkling three young trees, the trunks
of which are entwined together, and inscribed, "Painting,
Sculpture, Architecture." These promising saplings
are planted upon a gentle declivity. Painting
is on the highest ground, and Sculpture on the
lowest. It is worthy of remark that the fructifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
stream which issues from the watering-pot falls short
of the surface on which is planted the tree inscribed
Painting, and goes beyond the root of that termed
Sculpture; so that Architecture, which is much the
loftiest and most healthy tree, will have the principal
benefit of the water. If the tree of Painting is attentively
inspected, it will be found stunted in its
growth, withered at the top, and blest with only one
flourishing branch, which, if viewed with an eye to
what the artist has previously written, seems intended
for portrait-painting. The tree which is the symbol
for Sculpture appears to bend and withdraw itself
from the reservoir;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> one branch from the centre of
the trunk is probably funereal, and intended to intimate
sepulchral monuments. The top, being out of
sight, is left to the imagination.</p>

<p>Those who wish to inquire how far this allegorical
and sylvan symbol has proved prophetic of the
unequal encouragement now given to the different
branches of the arts, may go to Somerset House,
contemplate the building, pay their shilling, and
walk through the rooms of the Royal Academy
during the time of their annual exhibition!</p>

<p class="noindent">As a contrast to Britannia nurturing the trees that
are introduced in the last print, a travelling monkey
in full dress is in this industriously watering three
withered and sapless stems of what might once have
been flowering shrubs, and are inscribed "Exotics."
These wretched remnants of things which were, are
carefully placed in labelled flower-pots: on the first
is written, "<em>Obiit</em> 1502;" on the second, "<em>Obiit</em> 1600;"
and on the third, "<em>Obiit</em> 1606." Still adhering to
the hieroglyphics in his frontispiece, Hogarth introduces
these three dwarfish importations of decayed
nature to indicate the state of those old and damaged
pictures which are venerated merely for their antiquity,
and exalted above all modern productions,
from the name of a great master, rather than any
intrinsic merit. To heighten the ridicule, he has
given his monkey a magnifying glass that will draw
forth hidden beauties, which to common optics are
invisible.</p>

<p>So great was the demand for the catalogues with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the illustrative prints of Hogarth, that the two first
done were soon worn down, and Mr. Grignion was
employed to engrave others from the same drawings.
Beneath those that were first made there are no
mottoes; and the word <em>obiit</em> is written <em>obit</em>. This
was perhaps a mistake of either the painter or writing
engraver, though I think it barely possible that
the former might mean to pun on the connoisseurs
being bubbled by dealers in old pictures&mdash;O! <span class="fs80">BIT.</span></p>

<p>The opinion Hogarth has, in the preceding pages,
given of the taste and judgment of the public in his
own day may at first sight seem rather harsh, but
was in a degree justified by the scandalous inattention
with which the town received his six inimitable
pictures of "Marriage à la Mode;" they were, on the
6th of June 1750, sold by a kind of auction to Mr. Lane
of Hillingdon for one hundred and twenty guineas!
Being in Carlo Maratt frames that cost the artist
four guineas each, his real remuneration for painting
this admirable series was but a few shillings more
than one hundred pounds.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Such are the rewards of
genius. Low as this sum was, a Mr. Perry, being
eleven months afterwards erroneously informed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
still less had been the highest sum offered, and that
they were not sold, wrote the following letter with
an increased bidding. This gentleman's name is
inserted in Hogarth's subscription book as a subscriber
for four sets of "The Elections," with this
remarkable memorandum:&mdash;"<em>4th April 1754.</em>&mdash;The
whole eight guineas paid at the time of subscribing."
Out of near six hundred names, I find only two
(viz. Henry Raper, Esq., and Mr. Perry) who paid
more than half the money in the first subscription.</p>


<p class="center"><em>To Mr. Hogarth.</em></p>

so much are they worth of my money; with a promise

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="p2 negin2 fs80 lht">THE MOTIVES BY WHICH HOGARTH WAS INDUCED TO PUBLISH HIS
ANALYSIS OF BEAUTY; THE ABUSE IT DREW UPON HIM, AND
HIS VINDICATION OF HIMSELF AND THE VOLUME. HE IS
ELECTED A MEMBER OF THE IMPERIAL ACADEMY AT AUGSBURG,
AND APPOINTED SERJEANT PAINTER TO THE KING.</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/dc_083.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capx">Hogarth finding his prints were become
sufficiently numerous to form a handsome
volume, in the year 1745<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> engraved his
own portrait as a frontispiece. In one corner of the
plate he introduced a painter's palette, on which was
a waving line inscribed "The Line of Beauty." This
created much curious speculation, and, as he himself
expresses it, "The bait soon took, and no Egyptian
hieroglyphic ever amused more than it did for a
time. Painters and sculptors came to me to know
the meaning of it, being as much puzzled with it as
other people, till it came to have some explanation;
then, indeed, but not till then, some found it out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
be an old acquaintance of theirs,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> though the account
they could give of its properties was very near as
satisfactory as that which a day-labourer, who constantly
uses the lever, could give of that machine as
a mechanical power." "They knew it as Falstaff did
Prince Henry&mdash;by instinct!"</p>

<p>This crooked line drew upon him a numerous band
of opponents, and involved him in so many disputes,
that he at length determined to write a book, explain
his system, and silence his adversaries. When his
intentions were known, those who acknowledged his
claim to superiority as an artist were apprehensive
that, by thus wandering out of his sphere and commencing
author, he would lessen his reputation.
Those who ridiculed his system presumed that he
would thus overturn it; and the few who envied and
hated the man, rejoiced in sure and certain hope
that he would write himself into disgrace. All this
he laughed at, and in the following little epigram
whimsically enough describes his own feelings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"What! a book, and by Hogarth! then twenty to ten,</p>
<p class="verse">All he's gained by the pencil he'll lose by the pen.</p>
<p class="verse">Perhaps it may be so; howe'er, miss or hit,</p>
<p class="verse">He will publish,&mdash;here goes,&mdash;it's double or quit."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Notwithstanding this pleasantry preceding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
publication, he frankly acknowledges that the uncharitable
spirit with which he was in consequence
assailed, and the squabbles it drew him into with
those of his own profession, and the dabblers in the
arts, gave him greater uneasiness than was balanced
by its general success. Thus does he express himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My preface and introduction to the <cite>Analysis</cite>
contain a general explanation of the circumstances
which led me to commence author; but this has not
deterred my opponents from loading me with much
gross and, I think, unmerited obloquy; it therefore
becomes necessary that I should try to defend myself
from their aspersions.</p>

<p>"Among many other high crimes and misdemeanours
of which I am accused, it is asserted that
I have abused the great masters. This is so far
from being just, that when the truth is fairly stated
it may possibly appear that the professional reputation
of these luminaries of the arts is more injured
by the wild and enthusiastic admiration of those who
denominate themselves their fast friends, than by
men who are falsely classed as their enemies.</p>

<p>"Let us put a case: suppose a brilliant landscape
had been so finely painted by a first-rate artist, that
the trees, water, sky, etc. were boldly though tenderly
relieved from each other, and the eye of the
spectator might, as it were, travel into the scenery;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and suppose this landscape, by the heat of the sun,
the ravages of time, or the still more fatal ravages
of picture-cleaners, was shorn of its beams and deprived
of all its original brightness; let me ask
whether the man who will affirm that this almost
obliterated, unharmonious, spotty, patchwork piece
of antiquity is in the state that it first came out of
the artist's hands, does not abuse the painter?<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and
whether he who asserts that though it might once
have been bright and clear it is now faded, does not
thus place the defects to the proper account, and
consequently defend him?</p>

<p>"So far from attempting to lower the ancients, I
have always thought, and it is universally admitted,
that they knew some fundamental principles in nature
which enabled them to produce works that have been
the admiration of succeeding ages; but I have not
allowed this merit to those leaden-headed imitators,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
who, having no consciousness of either symmetry or
propriety, have attempted to mend nature, and in
their truly ideal figures gave similar proportions to a
Mercury and a Hercules.</p>

<p>"This, and many other opinions which I have
ventured to advance, has roused a nest of hornets
from whose stings I would wish to guard myself, as
I am conscious that they will try to condemn all my
works by my own rules. To disappoint these insects
I have, in my explanatory prints, done the Antinous,
Venus, etc. in a slighter style than the other figures,
to show that they are introduced as mere references
to the originals; and I will not now attempt to paint
my Goddess of Beauty.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Who can tell how long
the artist was employed in giving such exquisite
grace to the Grecian Venus? he might perhaps think
that a single super-excellent statue would confer
immortality, and was sufficient for a whole life. Can
any one expect to see equal perfection in that which
is done in little, and in a short space of time?</p>

<p>"With respect to beauty, though men felt its
effects, yet both artists and others appeared to me
to be totally ignorant of its principles, and contented
themselves with bestowing undistinguishing praise,
and giving us cold and servile copies of the fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
models of antiquity, without making any inquiry into
the system by which they were produced. The few
who wished to learn the principles found themselves
so bewildered and confounded by the vague and contradictory
opinions which they had heard and read
concerning beauty and grace, that they began to
suspect the whole to be an illusion, and that neither
one nor the other existed except in fancy and imagination.
This should excite less surprise, from its
having sometimes happened in a matter of an infinitely
higher and more important nature; and were
it politically right, it is possible that a small octavo
might be written, which would start as many folios
of theological controversy as would fill Westminster
Hall, though the whole put together might be mere
lumber, and of no more use than waste paper. But
this by the by. To return into my own path, and
resume the reasons that induced me to tread it in a
new character. In doing this, it will be proper to
give a succinct statement of the strange way in which
this subject has been treated by preceding writers.</p>

<p>"The first attempts that were made to fix true
ideas of taste upon a surer basis, were by natural
philosophers, who, in their amplified contemplations
on the universal beauty displayed in the harmony
and order of nature, very soon lost themselves; an
event that, from the way in which they set out, was
inevitable: for, if I may be permitted to adopt an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
allegorical figure, it necessarily led them into the
wide road of Order and Regularity, which they
unexpectedly found crossed and intersected by many
other paths that led into the Labyrinths of Variety;
where, not having passed through the Province of
Painting, they became confused, and could never find
their way. To explaining the order and usefulness
of nature they might be equal; but of her sportiveness
and fancy they were totally ignorant. To
extricate themselves from these difficulties, they
ascended the Mound of Moral Beauty, contiguous
to the open field of Divinity, where, rambling and
ranging at large, they lost all remembrance of their
former pursuit.</p>

<p>"These gentlemen having failed, it was next suggested
that the deeply read and travelled man was
the only person fully qualified to undertake the task
of analyzing beauty. But here let it be observed,
that a few things well seen, and thoroughly understood,
are more likely to furnish proper materials for
this purpose than the cursory view of all that can be
met with in a hasty journey through Europe.</p>

<p>"Nature is simple, plain, and true in all her works;
and those who strictly adhere to her laws, and closely
attend to her appearances in their infinite varieties,
are guarded against any prejudiced bias from truth;
while those who have seen many things that they
cannot well understand, and read many books which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
they do not fully comprehend, notwithstanding all
their pompous parade of knowledge, are apt to
wander about it and about it, perpetually perplexing
themselves and their readers with the various opinions
of other men.</p>

<p>"The knowledge necessary for writing a work on
the arts, differs as much from that acquired by the
simple traveller, as the art of simpling doth from the
science of botany. Taking the grand tour to see and
pick up curiosities, which the travellers are taught
nicely to distinguish from each other by certain
cramp marks and hard names, may, with no great
impropriety, be termed 'going a simpling;' but with
this special difference, that your 'field simpler' never
picks up a nettle for a marsh-mallow,&mdash;a mistake
which your 'tour simpler' is very liable to.</p>

<p>"As to those painters who have written treatises
on painting, they were in general too much taken up
with giving rules for the operative part of the art to
enter into physiological disquisitions on the nature of
the objects. With respect to myself, I thought I was
sufficiently grounded in the principles of my profession
to throw some new lights on the subject; and
though the pen was to me a new instrument, yet, as
the mechanic at his loom may possibly give as satisfactory
an account of the materials and composition
of the rich brocade he weaves as the smooth-tongued
mercer surrounded with all his parade of showy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
silks, I trusted that I might make myself tolerably
understood by those who would take the trouble of
examining my book and prints together; for as one
who makes use of signs and gestures to convey his
meaning in a language of which he has little knowledge,
I have occasionally had recourse to my pencil.
For this I have been assailed by every profligate
scribbler in town, and told that though 'words are
man's province,' they are not my province; and that
though I have put my name to the <cite>Analysis of
Beauty</cite>, yet (as I acknowledge having received some
assistance from two or three friends) I am only the
<em>supposed</em> author. By those of my own profession I
am treated with still more severity; pestered with
caricature drawings, and hung up in effigy in prints;
accused of vanity, ignorance, and envy; called a
mean and contemptible dauber; represented in the
strangest employments, and pictured in the strangest
shapes,&mdash;sometimes under the hieroglyphical semblance
of a satyr, and at others under the still more
ingenious one of an ass.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
<p>"Not satisfied with this, finding that they could
not overturn my system, they endeavoured to wound
the peace of my family. This was a cruelty hardly
to be forgiven: to say that such malicious attacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and caricatures did not discompose me, would be
untrue, for to be held up to public ridicule would
discompose any man; but I must at the same time
add that they did not much distress me. I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
that those who venture to oppose received opinions
must in return have public abuse: so that, feeling I
had no right to exemption from the common tribute,
and conscious that my book had been generally well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
received, I consoled myself with the trite observation
that every success or advantage in this world must be
attended by some sort of a reverse; and that though
the worst writers and worst painters have traduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
me, by the best I have had more than justice done
me. The partiality with which the world has received
my works, and the patronage and friendship with
which some of the best characters in it have honoured
the author, ought to excite my warmest gratitude,
and demands my best thanks. It enables me to despise
this cloud of insects; for happily, though their
buzzing may tease, their stings are not mortal."</p></div>

<p>That these hard blows of his adversaries were felt,
and felt keenly, appears from the whole tenor of his
language; but his mortifications were in a degree
balanced. The annexed letter, from a man of Warburton's
literary fame, was a flattering testimony to
his talents, though a gentleman to whom I read it
observed, that the Doctor might be as much actuated
by a fear of his satire as admiration of his abilities.
It enclosed a £10 bank note. By his friend Rouquet
he was informed that his book was eagerly expected
in Paris, and told in a note from the Vice-Chancellor
of Cambridge, that it would have a place in the University
library:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I expected to have been in England
about this time, but find myself disappointed by the
tediousness of the progress of what I have begun;
and business coming in very smartly, I believe I shall
stay here some months longer than I proposed at
first, therefore shall indulge myself with the pleasure
of writing these till I enjoy that of your conversation.
I have a thousand observations to impart to you
when we meet&mdash;some that will please you, some that
you will think inaccurate, but all such as will not
allow us time to yawn when we see one another.
First, I hope you are in perfect health, and the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
news I want to hear is, when your book is to be published.
I have raised some expectations about it
amongst artists and virtuosi here, and hope to have
the first that shall come over, that I may boast of
your friendship, by being the first usher of a performance
which I am sure will make many people
wish they were acquainted with you. The humbug
virtu is much more out of fashion here than in England.
Free-thinking, upon that and other topics, is,
if possible, more prevalent here than amongst you.
Old paintings and old stories fare much alike. A
dark picture is become a damned picture, as the
soul of the dealer; and, consequently, modern performances
are much encouraged,&mdash;and mine amongst
them,&mdash;for I have met with a reception much beyond
what I expected, or they deserved. This circumstance
has made Paris more agreeable to me than it
would have been without it. I pass my time in it
very swiftly, perpetually employed in a great variety
of unavoidable business. The days succeed one another
with great rapidity. Nevertheless, I think I
don't enjoy so good a health as in England, though I
was often ill there; but the hurry I have been in this
six months, which cannot be described, may be the
reason of it. I am afflicted with a continual headache,
which I have not been subject to this five-and-twenty
years, and which, if it should not abate, will occasion
my return before business will well admit. I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
you have before this time some spring days at Ivy
Hall. I shall have no country air this year, but am
going to lodge in the most open part of the town,
which I hope will do instead, that is, upon the Quay
de Conti, next to College Mazarine, where I shall be
in three weeks ready to receive the answer that I beg
you will favour me with.&mdash;I am, Sir, your humble

<p>Hogarth presented another copy to the Royal
Society; and by several of his books that were sent
abroad, he found that, however captiously the work
had been treated by some of his own countrymen, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
had its admirers on the Continent. From Mr. Reiffsten
of Cassel, in consequence of this publication, he
received a letter couched in most complimentary
terms, inviting him to become a counsellor and member
of the Imperial Academy at Augsburg,&mdash;an
invitation which, by his reply, he appears to have
accepted.</p>

<p>An Italian translation of his <cite>Analysis</cite> was published
at Leghorn, dedicated, "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">All' illustrissime Signora
Diana Molineux Dama Inglese.</span>" It had been previously
done into German by Mr. Mylins, a new
edition of whose translation is thus pompously announced
by Mr. C. F. Vok, in a written paper I found
among Hogarth's manuscripts:&mdash;</p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>Advertisement for a New Edition of Mr. Hogarth's

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If ever a work met with great applause and deserved
still more, it was certainly Mr. Hogarth's
<cite>Analysis of Beauty</cite>. The literary journals and newspapers
have amply and handsomely noticed it. The
author made the beauty of forms, which was the
object of his art, at the same time the subject of his
philosophical meditations, and fell at last upon a
system which was meant to ascertain in some degree
the various conceptions of mankind concerning the
agreeable, and to banish from the learned as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the vulgar the absurd proverb, that men neither can
nor ought to dispute about Taste. 'Tis therefore to
him we are indebted if the word beautiful, to which
people daily fix a thousand different ideas, becomes
for the future as much an object of reflection as it
has hitherto been of sensation. Yet this work does
not contain empty and fruitless speculations, which,
when they are not of practical use, justly merit the
name of whim and chimera; but its utility is equally
extensive with its subject, viz. the beauty of forms,
and all arts and sciences that have a relation to it will
borrow new light from the performance. The philosopher,
the naturalist, the antiquarian, the orator
(both in the pulpit and on the stage), the painter,
the statuary, the dancing-master, must consider it as
a book essentially necessary to them; and not only to
them, but also to those persons who are vain of being
thought connoisseurs, yet often form such contradictory
and inadequate judgment of what relates to
the imitation of natural beauty, that they but too
plainly betray their want of fixed and determinate
ideas. One may venture to affirm that the utility of
Mr. Hogarth's system will soon extend itself into the
empire of fashion; for even there, where nothing
reigned but occasional caprice, now something of
certainty may take its place by the assistance of this
theory.</p>

<p>Mr. Vok proposes taking subscriptions of one dollar

his proposals, which he dates from Berlin, 1st July

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;An universal reputation, and undisputed title
to superiority, cannot but draw upon you the importunities
of those who are ambitious of an <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'acquintance with men'">acquaintance
with men</ins> of genius. Ever since my first perusing
the <cite>Analysis of Beauty</cite>, in which the author is no less
to be admired than the artist, I have been on the
watch for a favourable opportunity of contributing
my share, though ever so small, to the thanks of the
public. In that ingenious and elaborate composition
you are allowed by all men of taste to have dispelled
the mist and cleared the difficulties that had previously
attended a problem in painting, of exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
nicety and the greatest moment. The most eminent
masters and most sagacious theorists had travelled in
the dark, or wandered through mazes in a fruitless
search after beauty. To you alone it was reserved to
unravel her windings, reveal her charms to open view,
and fix her hidden though genuine excellence.</p>

<p>"At length, sir, the opportunity I had so long
coveted seems to offer itself, of course. It is owing
to the erection of an Imperial Academy at Augsburg,
for the study and improvement of arts and letters. I
am commissioned as a deputy from the whole body
to interpret their sentiments, and to inform you how
highly they value and respect your uncommon talents
and capacity. Proud of the acquisition of one no less
distinguished in the republic of letters than in the
commonwealth of arts, they earnestly desire you
would accept the diploma of counsellor and honorary
member of their Academy. It is ready to be drawn
up, and will not fail being despatched so soon as they
are sure of your approbation; which, 'tis hoped, will
not be refused by one who has deserved so well of all
lovers of taste and genius. But before you take this
step it is but natural you should ask in what consists
the Academy of which you are solicited to become
a member, and whose existence, probably enough, is
not so much as suspected in England. To obviate so
proper an inquiry, suffer me, sir, to acquaint you in a
few words with its origin, constitution, and design.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"About three or four years since, some artists of
Augsburg formed themselves into a society, in order
to promote and encourage the imitative arts, especially
painting and engraving. They applied to the
Emperor for protection, which was graciously granted.
Soon after they published, at their own expense, a few
select pieces; but finding that the polite arts cannot
be brought to perfection without the help of literature,
and that to excel an artist must be something of a
scholar himself, or be assisted by men of learning,
they associated those to their body by whom they
might be furnished with instructions in writing upon
the two above-mentioned branches, and a correspondence
both within the empire and abroad properly
carried on. Having thus far met with success, they
began to extend their views, and endeavoured to fix
an institution for teaching methodically the art of
drawing or designing&mdash;an establishment much wanted
here in Germany. This scheme being laid before
the Imperial Court, the society obtained an ample
charter and considerable privileges. It was incorporated
under the denomination of 'an Academy of
Arts and Letters,' and the Emperor was pleased to
illustrate it with his own name. He conferred the
honour of knighthood upon the president, and the
title of imperial counsellor on the director, empowering
the members to choose those officers themselves;
and, moreover, to appoint counsellors and professors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to direct the teaching publicly the learned languages
and the liberal arts, with several other concessions
concerning the printing and publishing of their works.</p>

<p>"To crown their hopes, a common stock was still
wanting for the supply of unavoidable expenses, such
as salaries to masters and teachers, charges of the
press, etc. On this account they had recourse to a
tontine,&mdash;a kind of lottery, consisting of annuities for
life,&mdash;which has met with tolerable success, and will
produce a capital sufficient to defray all necessary
disbursements. But till this end be compassed, the
Academy confines itself to the publishing (by means
of artist members) plates engraved after the original
paintings of the best masters; and by the help of
such members as are men of letters, a journal or periodical
pamphlet, consisting of memoirs or essays
concerning those arts whose foundation is laid in
designing. The first part, by way of specimen, is to
come out before the close of this year, and it will be
regularly continued every month in the next.</p>

<p>"The chief materials are to be compiled by
members settled at Rome, Paris, Dresden, Stuttgard,
Copenhagen, Cassel, etc.</p>

<p>"How happy should we think ourselves, sir, if, not
only suffering your name to be joined in our lists to
those of Mengs, Lelio, Meilens, De Marcii, Wille
Schmid, Preissler, etc., you would, like those artists,

kindle our emulation, than to be informed by yourself,

the German diploma, he was, on the 6th of June
1757, still further dignified by being appointed
Serjeant Painter to the King of Great Britain, and
entered on the duties of his office on the 16th of the
following July. On the demise of George the Second,
his post necessarily became vacant; his present Majesty's
warrant for reinstating him is in my possession.
I have annexed a copy, which shows that the salary
was ten pounds per annum, payable quarterly. In one
of his manuscripts I find the following memorandum
of the interest by which he obtained the place, and
its annual profits:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Having, just after my brother's death, obtained,
by means of my friend Mr. Manning and the Duke
of Devonshire, which might not have exceeded one
hundred a year to me for trouble and attendance;
but by two portraits at more than eighty pounds
each, the last occasioned by his present Majesty's
accession, and some other things, it has for these
last five years been, one way or other, worth two
hundred pounds per annum."</p>
</div>

<p>Who these portraits were, or for whom they were
painted, I know not. By his manner of expressing
himself, I should suppose that they were royal, and,
as is customary, presented to some of the ambassadors,
in which case they were probably sent to the
Continent.</p>

THE VASE.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">As Dr. Townley, in the foregoing mythological
fragment, chooses to suppose that in the Greek
particles which compounded the name of Pythagoras
were to be found the letters <span class="lsp2 smcap">Hogarth</span>; Hogarth,
with a whimsicality somewhat similar, sported an
opinion that the first man who made a well-formed
vase took another man for his model. In page 78
of his <cite>Analysis</cite>, he remarks "that the exact cross of
two equal lines cutting each other in the middle, as
fig. 69, would confine the figure of a man drawn conformably
to them, to the disagreeable character of
his being as broad as he is long. And the two lines
crossing each other, to make the height and breadth
of a figure, will want variety a contrary way, by one
line being very short in proportion to the other, and
are therefore also incapable of producing a figure of
tolerable variety. To prove this, it will be very easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
for the reader to make the experiment by drawing a
figure or two (though ever so imperfectly), confined
within these limits.</p>

<p>"There is a medium between these, proper for every
character, which the eye will easily and accurately
determine.</p>

<p>"Thus, if the lines, fig. 70, were to be the measure
of the extreme length or breadth, set out either for
the figure of a man or a vase, the eye soon sees the
longest of these is not quite sufficiently so in proportion
to the other for a genteel man, and yet it
would make a vase too taper to be elegant; no rule
or compasses would decide this matter either so
quickly or so precisely as a good eye."</p>

<p>I apprehend that Hogarth intended to have introduced
this vase into the second print of his <cite>Analysis</cite>,
but found he had not room; for, on the same piece of
paper with the drawing, he thus continues the subject:</p>

<p>"We cannot wonder that many writers should have
imagined that the different orders of architecture have
been taken from the human form, since both are
governed by the same principles of <em>fitness</em>, <em>strength</em>,
and <em>beauty</em>.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The general opinion that the Corinthian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
capital was taken from a basket and dock leaves, may
be supported on the same grounds."</p>

<p>This leads him to one of his favourite ideas, a new
order of architecture.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<h4>HINTS FOR A NEW CAPITAL.</h4>

<img src="images/i_114d_fp.jpg" width="350" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
DESIGNS FOR CAPITALS.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Three of the examples are selected from the most
grotesque and ridiculous objects; the other two from
flowers; and the Bohemian feathers seem slight essays
to prove what he frequently advanced, that though he
considered the ancient orders with reverence, yet being
the productions of men, men might without heresy
venture to vary from them. He remarks: "That
churches, palaces, prisons, common houses, and summer
houses might be built more in distinct characters
than they are, by contriving orders suitable to each;
whereas, were a modern architect to build a palace
in Lapland or the West Indies, Palladio must be his
guide, nor would he dare to stir a step without his
book."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This architects peremptorily assert is the only
rule, nor dare they deviate from the established orders.
Should you press them hard for a reason, they will
tell you no man has yet been able to equal what has
been already done; which though I admit, yet have
I ventured to assert, and now repeat, that the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>beautiful order in the architecture of the ancients
will perfectly agree with the rules of composition laid
down in the <cite>Analysis</cite>, and that new orders, adapted
to various purposes, may be still invented. I cannot
help thinking it is possible that a man who understood
drawing, though he had never seen a column,
might, by applying the straight and waving line, and
correcting simplicity by variety, produce one with
equal beauty to any of them.</p>

<p>"In architecture, after <span class="fs80">FITNESS</span> hath been strictly
and geometrically complied with, all the additional
members or parts may, by attention to the proper
rules of composition, be continually varied and yet be
pleasing. For example, if the capitals composed of
the confined shapes of hats and wigs can be rendered
tolerable, what might not be done by selecting the
elegant varieties which are displayed in feathers,
flowers, shells, etc.?"<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

SQUARE &amp; ROUND HEADS.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The five heads in the annexed plate are copied from
sketches in my possession, and all of them seem to
have been intended for the illustration of his <cite>Analysis</cite>,
in which he remarks, that "the particular expressions
of a face or movement of a feature which becomes one
person shall be disagreeable in another, just as such
expressions or turns happen to fall in with the lines of
beauty or the reverse; for this reason there are pretty
frowns and disagreeable smiles: the lines that form a
pleasing smile about the corners of the mouth have
gentle windings, as fig. 1,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> but lose their beauty in
the full laugh; the expression of excessive laughter,
oftener than any other, gives a sensible face a silly or
disagreeable look, as it is apt to form regular plain
lines about the mouth (like a parenthesis), which
sometimes appear like crying."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In what we call plain lines there is this constant
and remarkable effect, that as they are more or less
conspicuous in any kind of character or expression in
the face, they bring along with them certain degrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of a foolish or a ridiculous aspect. The inimitable
Butler knew this, and describes the beard of Hudibras,
fig. 2:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseqx">'In cut and dye so like a tile,</p>
<p class="verse">A sudden view it would beguile.'</p>

almost as square as a die; and fig. 5, as truly round
as a globe. The effect of the latter is rather ridiculous
than ugly. Sir Plume's empty look, described in the
'Rape of the Lock,' would not be near so vacant
without the idea of roundness:</p>

<p class="center small">'With round unthinking face.'</p>

<p>"The dialogue between Cleopatra and the Messenger,

</div>

<p>To No. 3 he thus alludes in his <cite>Analysis</cite>, p. 128,
but has not engraved it in his explanatory plate,
though it would certainly have been a better example
than his old man's head, fig. 98:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Human nature can hardly be represented more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>debased than in the character of the Silenus, where
the bulging line runs through all the features of the
face, as well as the other parts of this swinish body;
whereas, in the satyr of the wood, though the ancients
have joined the brute with the man, we still see preserved
an elegant display of serpentine lines that
renders it graceful." His manuscript continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The fine airs and graceful turns and windings of
such a head were produced by adhering to this line;
and it was this Mr. Pope conceived of Raphael and
Guido in his epistle to Mr. Jarvis, the king's painter,
or he meant nothing:</p>

painted by his friends had his unqualified praise.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>

<p class="noindent">In Hogarth's manuscript of the <cite>Analysis</cite>, facing the
chapter on Fitness, I found a red-chalk sketch of
these three figures, which (with slight variations) he
has introduced in his illustrative prints. They are

sketched his first thoughts: they seem placed together
to contrast the easy and natural turn of the
Hercules with the stiff and artificial attitudes assumed
by the other two figures, in both of which uniformity
is the leading principle. Relative to this, Hogarth,
in p. 20 of the <cite>Analysis</cite>, puts the following query:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If uniform objects were agreeable, why is there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
such care taken to contrast and vary all the limbs of
a statue? Were the eye pleased with uniformity, the
picture of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> would be preferable to the
finely contrasted figures of Guido and Correggio;
and the Antinous' easy sway must submit to the stiff
and straight figure of the dancing-master.</p>

<p>"The 'Hercules' by Glycon (fig. 1) hath all
its parts finely fitted for purposes of the utmost
strength that the texture of the human form will
bear. The back, breast, and shoulders have huge
bones, and muscles adequate to the supposed active
strength of its upper parts; but as less strength was
required for the lower parts, the judicious sculptor,
contrary to all modern rule of enlarging every part in
proportion, lessened the size of the muscles gradually
down towards the feet, and for the same reason made
the neck larger in circumference than any part of the
head; otherwise the figure would have been burdened
with an unnecessary weight, which would have been
a drawback from his strength, and, in consequence of
that, from his characteristic beauty. These seeming
faults, which show the superior anatomical knowledge
as well as judgment of the ancients, are not to
be found in the leaden imitations near Hyde Park."</p>
</div>

<p>The bluff and boisterous Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> is described
in the same volume as forming a complete <span class="large">X</span> with his
legs and arms; and the pert and prim dancing-master
is so accomplished a person, that were he to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
see his scholar in the easy and gracefully-turned
attitude of the Antinous, he would cry shame! tell
him he looked as crooked as a ram's horn, and bid
him hold up his head, as he himself did. This figure
is said to be intended for Essex the dancing-master.</p>

<p>The very different position in which these three
strongly contrasted characters place their legs and
feet is worthy of observation.</p>

<p class="noindent">These figures, as well as the preceding, are copied
from sketches in the <span class="fs80">MS.</span> of the <cite>Analysis</cite>; the Italian
Jove, grasping a thunderbolt, is intended for Monsieur
Desnoyer dancing in a grand ballet. A reduced copy
of the figure is in the first plate to the <cite>Analysis</cite>,
placed as a companion to Quin in the character of
Brutus; and it must be acknowledged that the
English actor, in a wig which Gorgon's self might
own, is as fair a representative of a Roman general as
the dancer is of a deity.</p>

<p>The figures 1 and 2 are from Vandyke's portraits
of Charles <span class="fs80">I.</span> and Henrietta Maria. The former
is copied from one of that great painter's portraits,
and almost wholly made up of straight lines; the
latter, though drawn with an easy and elegant air,
Hogarth considers as not composed on the principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of the waving line, which he says Vandyke seems
never to have thought of. Thus does he characterize
that artist in the page that faced the sketches:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Rubens knew the waving line, but his contours
are rather overcharged. Vandyke, his scholar, perhaps
for fear of running into what he might think
gross in his master's manner, imitated nature just as
it chanced to present itself; and having an exact eye,
produced portraits which abound with delicacy and
simplicity; but when nature flagged he was tame, not
knowing that principle which might have raised his
ideas. His best works are, however, marked with
grace."</p>
</div>

<p>No. 3 is intended to represent one of those clumsy,
grotesque ornaments with which our cathedrals
abound, where a winged figure, perched in the niche
of an arch behind a shield, seems intended as a
guardian angel to the dust of the deceased hero,
whose armorial bearing is sometimes displayed in
the front.</p>

<p>The last engraving which I have taken from the
manuscript of the <cite>Analysis</cite>, makes an easy and
elegant form; and I have ventured to introduce it in
the <a href="#DOL">title-page</a> to this volume. The original drawing
is on the same leaf with two sketches of an ill-shaped
candlestick and torch thistle (Nos. 40 and 42), in the
first plate to the <cite>Analysis</cite>. I think it may be denominated
"The Dolphin Candlestick," as it is com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>posed
of dolphins and snakes, so twisted as to
combine his favourite serpentine line, and crowned
with the iris and lily. In his <span class="fs80">MS.</span>, after remarking
that "our furniture and utensils are generally as
tasteless and inelegant as straight and unvaried lines
can make them,"&mdash;and producing as examples the ill-shaped
candlesticks, etc., which are engraved in his
first plate,&mdash;he concludes by observing, "It is said in
vindication of such forms, that they are adhered to
for the sake of simplicity; but this might be preserved,
and yet some portion of beauty introduced,
did they combine their little variations by the proper
rules."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Let the 'Dolphin Candlestick,' composed of serpentine
lines varying with each other, be compared
with No. 40, plate <span class="fs80">I</span>, which is made up of plain unvaried
parts, and it will show, in a much clearer view
than can be expressed by words, the necessity of
variety to constitute beauty.</p>

<p>"Nature gives us a few examples of tasteless forms
in the torch thistle, and some other ill-shaped exotics
to be found in green-houses, which form a striking
contrast to such flowers as the Chalcedonian iris and
lily, whose enchanting beauty proceeds from their
variety&mdash;these two flowers united form a nozzle to
the candlestick above alluded to."</p>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding Hogarth's perpetual reference to
the line of grace and analysis of the line of beauty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
he has been generally said to be totally incapable of
imparting either one or the other to his figures. Mr.
Nichols, in his <cite>Anecdotes</cite>, insists on his notorious
deficiency in what is styled "the graceful," and in
page 48 quotes Mr. Garrick's opinion to corroborate
his own. The writer of the <cite>North Briton</cite>, No. 17,
boldly asserts that he never caught a single idea of
beauty, grace, or elegance. Mr. Walpole, who is
generally candid and liberal in his praise, declares
him totally devoid of the principle, and, quoting the
first plate of his <cite>Analysis</cite> as an example, concludes
the sentence by remarking, that "the two figures of
a young lord and lady, which are added as samples
of grace," are strikingly stiff and affected. I do not
know that the artist intended them to be otherwise;
he has not referred to them as models in his book,
and, it is but fair to think, meant them as leading
figures, less <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</i> in their forms, but nearly as affected
in their graces, as the other dancers. His object
seems to be, exemplifying grace by what it is not
rather than by what it is. Whatever were his motives
for thus amplifying awkwardness in the Wandsworth
assembly,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> the annexed design, which may be
considered as its contrast, he has either composed
on a different principle, or, by a most happy and
singular accident, grouped some very easy and elegant
forms with much taste.</p>

<img src="images/i_124a_fp.jpg" width="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
THE DANCE.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Was designed and engraved in the year 1723 for the
first volume of De la Mottraye's <cite>Travels</cite>. In p. 159,
this tedious writer tells us, in some very ill-arranged
sentences, that the Greek women in the isle of Scio,
where the scene is laid, have a striking pre-eminence
over those of any other island in the Archipelago
for beauty as well as gaiety, and, some say, likewise
for complaisance. They verify the proverb, "Merry
as a Greek," dance every Sunday or holiday in the
open air, and in ring, as represented in the print;
and on such occasions wine is not spared.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> He describes
fig. 1 as a chief woman of Smyrna, and fig. 7
as her daughter; fig. 4 as a Greek woman of Constantinople,
and fig. 3 as a country girl of Scio, in a
habit peculiar to that place.</p>

<p>From these slender materials the artist made his
design in a style which proves (notwithstanding the
total deficiency of taste alleged by his biographers),
that at this early period of his life he had the power
of delineating figures with some portion of grace.</p>

<p>It may possibly be asked, why examples of this
do not more frequently occur in his other works?
To which I can only answer, that his scenes were
almost invariably laid in his own country, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
painted objects as he saw them; and whatever grace
the Grecian habit might give to the beauties of Scio,
the Germanic garb, in which the beauties of Britain
then disguised themselves,</p>

<p class="center small">"Chastely conceal'd each charm from every eye."</p>

<p>Mr. Benjamin Wilson the painter, in the letter that
follows, puts a query concerning a disputed point in
perspective, which was adopted by Hogarth, in support
of his friend Kirby, who, in the epistle that
succeeds it, after returning his acknowledgments for
the drawing that Sullivan engraved for his book,
requests the author of the <cite>Analysis</cite> to give him some
supplementary support in his doctrine of parallel
columns, etc., for the volume he was then printing
on perspective. This Hogarth did not then comply
with; but when Mr. Highmore, a short time afterwards,
attacked the system and its author in the
preface of a pamphlet, Hogarth, in support of both,
and to ridicule the erroneous principles of his opponent,
wrote Kirby some whimsical strictures, which
have been already published in the <cite>Graphic Illustrations</cite>.
As they are immediately connected with the
letter which is subjoined, I have inserted them in a
note, and added such extracts from Highmore's and
Kirby's prefaces as may elucidate the subject in
debate, and enable the reader to draw his own conclusions:&mdash;</p>

it as I improve, that the world may have one
instance of your invariable principles being true. An
odd appearance was mentioned to me lately, which
it seems is a fact. A parallelogram, viewed obliquely
at a given distance, forms a different representation
when seen through a telescope than it does when

remote end of the parallelogram appears larger than
the near end, whilst in the other case it appears
smaller than the near end.</p>

which was the reason of my not returning
you my most hearty thanks for the above favour
long before this time, and therefore I hope your
goodness will excuse it.</p>

<p>"The design which you have favoured me with
is the best that can be thought of for its intended
purpose, as it tends to recommend the study of perspective

to have it engraved by Mr. Sullivan, and shall send
it to him as soon as I know how to direct to him,
unless any other person is more agreeable to you for
that purpose.</p>

any that are too tenacious of mathematical rules, I'll
give them a cross-buttock with the 'Dissertations,'

<p>For another of Mr. Kirby's publications Hogarth
designed a frontispiece, which was engraved by Mr.

FRONTISPIECE TO THE PERSPECTIVE OF ARCHITECTURE.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is thus explained by Mr. Malton in the appendix
to his <cite>Treatise on Perspective</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here is a curious frontispiece, designed by Mr.
Hogarth, but not in the same ludicrous style as the
former (<em>i.e.</em> the frontispiece to Kirby's <cite>Perspective</cite>): it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>were to be wished that he had explained its meaning;
for, being symbolical, the meaning of it is not so
obvious as the other (that on false perspective). To
me it conveys the idea which Milton so poetically describes
of the angel Uriel gliding down to Paradise on
a sunbeam; but the young gentleman has dropped
off before he had arrived at his journey's end, with
Palladio's book of architecture on his knees. A ray
of light from the sun, rising over a distant mountain,
is directed to a scroll on the ground on which
are two or three scraps of perspective, over which,
supported by a large block of stone, is the upper part
of a sceptre broke off; the shaft, very obliquely and
absurdly inclined, somewhat resembling the Roman
fasces, and girt above with the Prince of Wales'
coronet as an astragal, through which the fasces rise
and swell into a crown adorned with embroidered
stars; this is the principal object, but most vilely
drawn. The ray passes through a round temple at
a considerable distance, which is also falsely represented,
the curves being, for the distance, too round,
and consequently the diminution of the columns is
too great. It appears to pass over a piece of water:
on this side the ground is fertile and luxuriant with
vegetation, abounding with trees and shrubs; on the
other side it is rocky and barren. What is indicated
by this seems to be, that where the arts are encouraged
by the rays of royal favour, they will thrive and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
flourish; but where they are neglected, and do not
find encouragement, they will droop and languish."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>On the ray from the sun rising over a distant
mountain, etc., so facetiously treated by Mr. Malton,
some light is thrown in a manuscript chapter of the
<cite>Analysis</cite>, where Hogarth, describing painters' colours,
remarks that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Sir Isaac Newton's theory of light and colours,
though excellent in itself, is an inquiry of so different
a nature from ours, that were we to take this great
philosopher as our guide, he would not assist but
mislead us, as he did Dr. Brook Taylor, the ingenious
author of the best book on perspective that ever was
written. The Doctor printed an appendix to this
work, which he entitled, <cite>A New Theory for Mixing
Colours</cite>, taken from Sir Isaac Newton's optics; but
his project, though ingenious in speculation, is altogether
impracticable in painting."</p>
</div>

<p>This observation Hogarth follows by the annexed
remarks on those visionaries who had puzzled the
doctrine of colours with minute and unnecessary
divisions, and adopted a strange notion that these
divisions were governed by the same laws as music:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Both Albert Durer and Lomazzo, who wrote on
painting, had this conceit; and so much was Père
Castle, a French theoretical doctor, impressed with
the idea, that with infinite pains and trouble he contrived
a harpsichord to play <em>harmonious composition
of colours</em>! On this he wrote a book, and built a
system in which prism colours were his notes; these
the keys of his instrument were to produce at pleasure.
But surely he could not have been drawn into such an
absurdity without having first persuaded himself that
colours and sounds were of the same nature, and that
the like disposition of them both would answer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
same purpose, <em>i.e.</em> that a jig in notes would be a jig
in colours.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> I should not be much surprised if some
native of that nation of <em>taste</em> contrived an instrument
for cookery on a similar plan.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> This would without
doubt be adopted in England, where it must unquestionably
have great encouragement. How pleasant
would it be to mark Monsieur de Quisiney at his
harpsichord, composing a grand festino for the entertainment
of foreign ministers; and would the inventor
compose a banquet for an installation, or a feast for
a Lord Mayor's day, it would ensure him the hearts
of both courtiers and citizens. What delight would it
afford to a certain eminent composer to see his two
favourite sciences thus united!<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"The fact is, that though compositions of music
and colours may illustrate each other in their principles,
they very essentially differ in their effects.
The notes on a scale in music will range similar to
the colours in a rainbow, or to those separated by the
prism, but their operations are precisely opposite.</p>

<p>"For example, let all the keys of an harpsichord
be pressed down at one stroke, and the ear will be
offended with harsh, jarring, and confused sounds;
but if you run your fingers along them in succession,
it produces a sort of harmony. In colours it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
directly the reverse; for though the varied hues of the
rainbow strike the eye agreeably at first sight, yet
were flickering colours to follow each other in quick
succession, the optic nerve would suffer pain in proportion
as the tints were more or less vivid, and
played in quick or slow time."</p>
</div>

<p>These observations are followed by some hints on
easy deportment, and succeeded by the following
desultory thoughts, which in his manuscript Hogarth
entitles "A Supplementary Chapter on Dress:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Dress is so copious a topic, that it would afford
sufficient matter for a large volume. The amazing
force and folly of fashion is placed in a most
ridiculous point of view in an old book called the
<cite>Artificial Changeling</cite>, where the author not only
describes the uncouth, wild, and extravagant mode
of clothing the body in different ages and countries,
but also states many detestable and barbarous customs
of whole nations, who mould and torture the
human frame to destroy its original form. Some of
the customs that he enumerates are, I believe, still
practised, particularly in China, where the feet of the
females are bandaged to prevent their growing; and
among the Hottentots, where, to improve their children's
faces, they break the gristles of their noses.
Such is the force of habit, that the eye is soon reconciled,
and these horrid disproportions and deformities
are considered as beauties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"In this country, fancy and the love of change, to
which we may sometimes add public and private
interest, have generally given the lead to fashion;
nor is it to be objected to,&mdash;sumptuary laws are not
consonant to the spirit of a free people. In dress
nothing need be restrained except the folly (I had
almost said wickedness) of changing the form or
colour of nature.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>"As to the fashion of men's dresses, if they are not
rendered inconvenient, it is of little consequence: the
tailors may contrive them as they will.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> But for the
sex to whom nature has been so bountiful to disguise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>their enchanting forms, and sacrifice ease, elegance,
and grace on the shrine of fashion, is defying
symmetry and thwarting nature, which, in their
capricious variations, they should sometimes suffer to
take fancy by the hand. The principles laid down
for sculpture, etc., will apply to dress; and fitness,
propriety, and convenience being first established, it
should be rendered pleasing. Attention to a few
plain and simple rules would be conducive to its
being made so.</p>

<p>"For a degree of uniformity there is a necessity,
as without it our habits would be neither commodious
nor comfortable; but when uniformity can be corrected
by taste, or rendered less obtrusive by slight
variations, the appearance will be more graceful and
becoming. Thus, feathers, jewels, and flowers should
usually be worn on one side of the head.</p>

<p>"Painters describe this disposition of ornament, etc.
by the word picturesque, and have contrived what
they call a fancy dress. This is wholly at their own
disposal, and they profess to combine in it all the
principles of beauty. But, unhappily, should their
figures walk across the room, these fantastic garments
would drop from their shoulders. Were they contrived
with a little attention to common sense, they
might have their uses. Such a succedaneum would
not only keep their works out of the reach of ill-natured
critics, by covering false anatomy, etc., but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
give an artist such latitude for light and shadow as
might enable him to shine in the grand historical
style; though in painting the manners of the present
day, where dress forms a part of the character, he
might be totally at a loss. On the same ground that
I think it more difficult to delineate scenes built on
real life than to display such as originate in fiction,
I believe it an easier task to write tragedy than
comedy: I mean true comedy, not a Dutch droll.
Dress is in some cases an index to the mind, and
characters in improper habits would destroy the
illusion at the best performed play.</p>

<p>"Simplicity, little as it is attended to, is the most
attractive principle of beauty. By this I mean that
the habit should not be divided into too many parts,
like an old-fashioned furbelowed and flounced petticoat:
this preposterous mode confounds the eye, and
gives an idea of rags and tatters. The plain unadorned
dress of a country girl is often more engaging
than the richest court habit, in which beauty
is frequently obscured, overwhelmed, and buried by
gaudy and heavy ornaments that totally destroy the
effect they are intended to produce. Yet here, as in
composition, simplicity must be corrected by intricacy,
to prevent its degenerating into meanness.
Parts of every dress should be loose, and at liberty to
play into folds, some of which will move with the
figure; nay, it sometimes produces grace to contrive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
things to rest in winding forms, as is demonstrated by
the figure of a sphinx.</p>

<p>"Quantity, as I have before remarked, adds
dignity; robes of state are always made large and
full; the long sweeping trains of queens have a
majestic effect. To attain this, the ladies endure
great fatigue, and encumber themselves with an
enormous hoop petticoat, as much as they would by
carrying a pair of panniers on their hips. While
they preserve the figure of the pyramid, this produces
some degree of dignity, but excess renders it ridiculous.</p>

<p>"The horse-grenadier, mounted, caparisoned with
his sword and other accoutrements, gives a good
example of the noble effect of quantity, so combined
as to come within pyramidal lines. What a contrast
would it produce, to see the little jockey fitted,
trimmed, and pared down for a race, riding by the
side of him!"</p></div>
</div>

<p>Hogarth concludes with a remark, which intimates
that he had originally intended to have inserted the
preceding chapter in his <cite>Analysis</cite>, but altered his
plan and reserved it for his intended Supplement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The even and uniform colour of the hair, by
encompassing the face as a frame doth a picture,
contrasts with harmonious colour its variegated and
enclosed composition, and adds more or less beauty
thereto, according to the manner it is disposed. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
graceful ornament may, with some propriety, be
called the head-dress, and comes under that class;
but as dress in general is a matter of no small importance
to a great part of the world, it deserves to
be treated more copiously than this volume will admit
of. It shall therefore be deferred till a more convenient
opportunity offers, when the Supplement
shall be published."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="p2 negin2 fs80 lht">HOGARTH'S INDUCEMENT TO PAINTING THE PICTURE OF SIGISMUNDA.
HIS CORRESPONDENCE WITH LORD GROSVENOR ON
THIS SUBJECT, CONTRASTED BY TWO LETTERS FROM LORD
CHARLEMONT, FOR WHOM HE HAD PREVIOUSLY PAINTED AN
INTERESTING SCENE. ORIGIN OF THE QUARREL WITH WILKES
AND CHURCHILL, WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE PRINT OF THE
BEAR, ETC.; AND THE ARTIST'S DEATH.</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/dc_144.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capx">The particulars relative to the picture of
"Sigismunda," Hogarth has himself inserted
in his subscription-book, on the leaves of
which he has pasted his correspondence with Lord
Charlemont and Lord Grosvenor, and a proof print
of MacArdell's copy from Correggio's picture. In a
little blue memorandum book he resumes the subject,
and concludes with a narrative of his quarrel with
Wilkes and Churchill, which ends with the word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Finis</i>.</p>

<p>In these and some other loose papers, after having
stated the professional injury which he had sustained
from his opponents asserting, and the public
believing, that he could not paint portraits, he continues:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Being thus driven out of the only profitable
branch of my profession, I at first thought of attach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>ing
myself to history-painting; but in this there was
no employment, for in forty years I had only two
orders of any consequence for historical pictures.
This was rather mortifying; and being, by the profits
of my former productions and the office of serjeant
painter, tolerably easy in my circumstances, and
thoroughly sick of the idle quackery of criticism, I
determined to quit the pencil for the graver. In this
humble walk I had one advantage; the perpetual
fluctuations in the manners of the times enabled me
to introduce new characters, which being drawn from
the passing day, had a chance of more originality and
less insipidity than those which are repeated again,
and again, and again from old stories. Added to
this, the prints which I had previously engraved were
now become a voluminous work, and circulated not
only through England, but over Europe. These
being secured to me by an Act which I had previously
got passed, were a kind of an estate; and as
they wore, I could repair and re-touch them, so that
in some particulars they became better than when
first engraved.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>"While I was making arrangements to confine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
myself entirely to my graver, an amiable nobleman
(Lord Charlemont) requested that, before I bade a
final adieu to the pencil, I would paint him one
picture; the subject to be my own choice, and the
reward&mdash;whatever I demanded. The story I pitched
upon was a young and virtuous married lady, who,
by playing at cards with an officer, loses her money,
watch, and jewels; the moment when he offers them
back in return for her honour, and she is wavering at
his suit, was my point of time.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>"The picture was highly approved of, and the
payment was noble; but the manner in which it was
made, by a note enclosed in one of the following
letters, was to me infinitely more gratifying than
treble the sum:&mdash;</p>

But the truth is, having wrong calculated my expenses,
I find myself unable for the present even to
attempt paying you. However, if you be in any

beg you would think that I by no means attempt to

<p>"This elevating circumstance had its contrast, and
brought on a train of most dissatisfactory circumstances,
which by happening at a time when I thought
myself, as it were, landed, and secure from tugging
any longer at the oar, were rendered doubly distressing.</p>

<p>"A gentleman (now a nobleman) seeing this picture,
pressed me with much vehemence to paint
another for him upon the same terms. To this I
reluctantly assented; and as I had been frequently
flattered for my power of giving expression, I thought
the figure of Sigismunda weeping over the heart of
her lover would enable me to display it. Impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
with this idea, I fixed upon this very difficult subject.
My object was dramatic, and my aim to draw tears
from the spectator,&mdash;an effect I have often witnessed
at a tragedy; and it therefore struck me that it was
worth trying if a painter could not produce the same
effect, and touch the heart through the eye, as the
player does through the ear.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Thus far I have been
gratified: I have more than once seen the tear of
sympathy trickle down the cheek of a female while
she has been contemplating the picture.</p>

<p>"As four hundred pounds had a short time before
been bid for a picture of 'Sigismunda,' painted by a
French master, but falsely ascribed to Correggio, four
hundred pounds was the price at which I rated this.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>"By any other of my pursuits I could have got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>twice the sum in the time I devoted to it; nor was
it more than half what a fashionable face-painter
would have gained in the same period. Upon these
grounds I put it at this sum; see the letter, and see
the answer. It ended by my keeping the picture in
my painting-room, and his Lordship keeping his
money in his pocket. Had it been Charlemont!"</p>
</div>

<p>This transaction having given rise to many ridiculous
falsehoods, the following unvarnished tale will
set the whole in its true light:&mdash;</p>


<p class="p1 right small">"<em>January 1764.</em></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The picture of 'Sigismunda' was painted at the
earnest request of Sir Richard Grosvenor (now Lord
Grosvenor) in the year 1759, at a time when Mr.
Hogarth had fully determined to leave off painting,
partly on account of ease and retirement, but more
particularly because he had found by thirty years'
experience that his pictures&mdash;except in an instance
or two, mentioned in the note<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>&mdash;had not produced
him one quarter of the profit that arose from his
engravings. However, the flattering compliments,
as well as generous offers, made him by the above
gentleman (who was immensely rich), prevailed upon
the unwary artist to undertake this difficult subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
which being seen and fully approved of by his Lordship
whilst in hand, was, after much time, and the
utmost efforts, finished. <em>But how!</em> the painter's
death (as usual) can only positively determine. The
price required for it was therefore not on account of
its value as a picture, but proportioned to the value
of the time it took in painting.</p>

<p>"This nobleman in the interim fell into the clutches
of the dealers in old pictures; the treatment a man
who painted new ones was to expect where these
gentry once get a footing<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> so much alarmed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
artist, that he thought it best to set his Lordship at
full liberty to take or reject the picture by writing
the following letter, and putting him in mind of the
agreement which was made when the work was
undertaken:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="center"><em>Mr. Hogarth's Letter to Sir Richard Grosvenor.</em></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have done all I can to the picture of
'Sigismunda.' You may remember you was pleased
to say you would give me what price I should think
fit to set upon any subject I would paint for you;
and at the time that you made this generous offer,
I in return made it my request that you would use
no ceremony in refusing the picture when done, if
you should not be thoroughly satisfied with it. This
you promised should be as I pleased, which I now
entreat you will comply with, without the least hesitation,
if you think four hundred too much money
for it.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> One more favour I have to beg, which is,
that you will determine on this matter as soon as you
can conveniently, that I may resolve whether I shall
go about another picture for Mr. Hoare the banker,
on the same conditions, or stop here.&mdash;I am, etc.</p>

Mr. Hoare for a picture. If he should have taken a
fancy to the 'Sigismunda,' I have no sort of objection
to your letting him have it; for I really think
the performance so striking and inimitable, that the
constantly having it before one's eyes would be too
often occasioning melancholy ideas to arise in one's

notice of the affair, here it must have ended; but
things having been represented in favour of his Lordship,
and much to Mr. Hogarth's dishonour, the foregoing
plain tale is therefore submitted to such as
may at any time think it worth while to see <em>the whole
truth</em> in what has been so publicly talked of."</p>
</div>

<p>To vindicate his fame, Hogarth at one time determined
to have the picture engraved, and Mr.
Ravenet undertaking it, "a subscription for the print
was begun March 2d, 1761;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> but, some time afterwards,
finding that Mr. Ravenet was under articles
not to work for any one except Mr. Boydell for
three years then to come, the subscription was put
a stop to, and the money returned to the subscribers,
there being no other engraver at leisure capable of
doing it as it should be done."</p>

<p class="right small">"<em>January 2, 1764.</em></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"All efforts to this time to get the picture finely
engraved proving in vain, Mr. Hogarth humbly hopes
his best endeavours to engrave it himself will be
acceptable to his friends."</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="pad10">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dryden's</span> <em>Sigismunda</em>.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">On the comparative merit of the two pictures of
"Sigismunda" there have been various opinions. By
the foregoing narrative it appears that Hogarth never
paid so much attention to any preceding production;
but in works of imagination success is not always
proportionate to labour, and his performance might
not be equal to his exertions. Be that as it may, this
was the criterion by which he estimated its worth;
and by the political disputes in which he was afterwards
engaged with Wilkes and Churchill, this estimation
was turned against himself. His opponents
discovered his parental partiality for "Sigismunda;"
and to wound the artist in his most vulnerable part,
they mangled her without mercy.</p>

<p>Mr. Walpole's critique did not appear until after
Hogarth's death; but when he gravely states Hogarth's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
performance to be more ridiculous than anything the
artist had ever ridiculed, it ceases to be criticism.
The best reply to so extravagant an assertion, is
the original picture now in the possession of Messrs.
Boydell, which, though not well coloured, and rather
French, is marked with mind, and would probably
have been better had it not been so often altered
on the suggestions of different critical friends. Mr.
Walpole contrasts it with that painted by Correggio
(or Furino), on which, at the expense of the poor
English artist, he bestows most extravagant and unqualified
praise; asserting that it is impossible "to
see the picture, or read Dryden's inimitable tale, and
not feel that the same spirit animated both poet and
painter." That the reader may form his own opinion
by comparison, I have annexed a copy from MacArdell's
admirable print; and as both sides ought to
be heard, I have subjoined the following remarks
from the <cite>Monthly Register of Literature</cite>, vol. ii., in
which is a critique (possibly written by Mr. Joshua
Kirby), as extravagant in the abuse of this picture as
Mr. Walpole is in its praise. It is here stated that
these observations were written for private use by a
professional man whose name is well known as the
author of a treatise on painting and perspective; it
begins with some remarks on Miss Edwards' sale in
1746, and concludes with several strictures on Sir
Luke Schaub's in April 1756: "Sir Luke's pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
(only 178) sold for £7784! a lucky collection for his
heir, but unlucky for Sir Luke's reputation as a judge
of painting." After several severe remarks on some
of the preceding lots, the writer observes of "No. 59,&mdash;'Sigismunda
Weeping over the Heart of Tancred,'
called a Correggio,&mdash;that this picture is an undoubted
copy; nothing in the character of Sigismunda but
sorrow to recommend it. The painter might take it
from his cook-maid, there being nothing elegant or
delicate in her appearance. The virtuosi ran it up
to £400; but Sir Thomas Sebright, at the desire of
the proprietor, bought it in for £404, 5s. He soon
discovered his mistake, for in reality it was worth
no more than ten guineas."</p>

<p>Though I cannot consent to view this picture
through the medium of Mr. Walpole's overcharged
panegyric, which gives to the artist a power that is
not in the art, and seems heightened for the pure
purpose of sinking Hogarth by the contrast; yet I
by no means meet this indiscriminate and unfounded
censure. It is many years since I saw the picture
in the Duke of Newcastle's collection, and I then
thought it sublimely conceived and finely coloured.
MacArdell's print gives a faithful representation of
the character, and the annexed head is a correct
copy.</p>

<p>Hogarth still bearing in mind this transaction, in
which he thought himself very ill-used, continues his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
narrative, and concludes with a recital of the circumstances
which occasioned his quarrel with Mr. Wilkes,
etc.; this much hurt his feelings, and in the progress
of it I have ever thought he was unjustly and most
inhumanly treated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As the most violent and virulent abuse thrown
on 'Sigismunda' was from a set of miscreants, with
whom I am proud of having been ever at war, I mean
the expounders of the mysteries of old pictures, I
have been sometimes told they were beneath my
notice. This is true of them individually; but as
they have access to people of rank, who seem as
happy in being cheated as these merchants are in
cheating them, they have a power of doing much
mischief to a modern artist. However mean the
vendor of poisons, the mineral is destructive; to me
its operation was troublesome enough. Ill-nature
spread so fast, that now was the time for every little
dog in the profession to bark, and revive the old
spleen which appeared at the time of the <cite>Analysis</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
The anxiety that attends endeavouring to recollect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
ideas long dormant, and the misfortunes which clung
to this transaction, coming at a time when nature
demands quiet, and something besides exercise to
cheer it, added to my long sedentary life, brought
on an illness which continued twelve months. But
when I got well enough to ride on horseback I soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
recovered. This being at a period when war abroad
and contention at home engrossed every one's mind,
prints were thrown into the background; and the
stagnation rendered it necessary that I should do
some timed thing, to recover my lost time and stop
a gap in my income. This drew forth my print of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
'The Times,' a subject which tended to the restoration
of peace and unanimity, and put the opposers
of these humane objects in a light which gave great
offence to those who were trying to foment destruction
in the minds of the populace. One of the most
notorious among them, till now rather my friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and flatterer, attacked me in a <cite>North Briton</cite>, in so
infamous and malign a style, that he himself, when
pushed even by his best friends, was driven to so
poor an excuse as to say, 'he was drunk when he
wrote it.' Being at that time very weak, and in a
kind of slow fever, it could not but seize on a feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
mind. My philosophical friends advise me to laugh
at the nonsense of party writing&mdash;who would mind
it?&mdash;but I cannot rest myself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseqx">'Who steals my gold steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;</p>
<p class="verse">'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:</p>
<p class="verse">But he that filches from me my good name,</p>
<p class="verse">Robs me of that which not enriches him,</p>
<p class="verse">And makes me poor indeed.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>"Such being my feelings, my great object was to
return the compliment, and turn it to some advantage.</p>

<p>"This renowned patriot's portrait drawn, like as I
could as to features, and marked with some indications
of his mind, fully answered my purpose. The
ridiculous was apparent to every eye. A Brutus!
a saviour of his country with such an aspect! was so
arrant a farce, that, though it gave rise to much
laughter in the lookers-on, galled both him and his
adherents to the bone. This was proved by the
papers being every day crammed with invectives
against the artist, till the town grew absolutely sick
of thus seeing me always at full length.</p>

<p>"Churchill, Wilkes' toad-eater, put the <cite>North
Briton</cite> into verse in an epistle to Hogarth; but as
the abuse was precisely the same, except a little
poetical heightening, which goes for nothing, it made
no impression, but perhaps in some measure effaced
or weakened the black strokes of the <cite>North Briton</cite>.
However, having an old plate by me, with some parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
ready, such as the background and a dog, I began to
consider how I could turn so much work laid aside
to some account; so patched up a print of Master
Churchill in the character of a Bear. The pleasure
and pecuniary advantage which I derived from these
two engravings, together with occasionally riding on
horseback, restored me to as much health as can be
expected at my time of life.</p>

<p>"Thus have I gone through the principal circumstances
of a life which, till lately, passed pretty much
to my own satisfaction, and, I hope, in no respect
injurious to any other man. This I can safely assert,
I have invariably endeavoured to make those about
me tolerably happy, and my greatest enemy cannot
say I ever did an intentional injury; though, without
ostentation, I could produce many instances of men
that have been essentially benefited by me. What
may follow, God knows.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Finis.</span>"</p></div>

<p>Such is the candid and dispassionate appeal which
this unequalled artist and excellent man makes to
his contemporaries and to posterity.</p>

<p>In October 1764, he died of an aneurism at his
house in Leicester Fields. His remains were removed
to his family vault at Chiswick. The epitaph

<p class="drop-capy">With talents equally honourable to himself,
his country, and the age in which he lived,
Hogarth did not leave his widow possessed
of much more than arose from the sale of his
prints. But during the twenty-five years which she
survived him, she had the higher and more exalted
gratification of finding that his reputation increased,
and his fame acquired stability by time.</p>

<p>In the year 1780, the late Horace Lord Orford
published his <cite>Anecdotes</cite>, in which he has introduced
Hogarth's catalogue and character. The volume
printed at Strawberry Hill, he (with the preceding
part of the work) presented to Mrs. Hogarth. The
books were accompanied with the following handsome
apology for his strictures on the genius of her
husband:<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Walpole begs Mrs. Hogarth's acceptance of
the volume that accompanies this letter, and hopes
she will be content with his endeavours to do justice
to the genius of Mr. Hogarth. If there are some
passages less agreeable to her than the rest, Mr.
Walpole will regard her disapprobation only as
marks of the goodness of her heart, and proofs of her
affection to her husband's memory; but she will,
he is sure, be so candid as to allow for the duty
an historian owes to the public and himself, which
obliges him to say what he thinks, and which when
he obeys, his praise is corroborated by his censure.
The first page of his Preface will more fully make his
apology;<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and his just admiration of Mr. Hogarth,
Mr. W. flatters himself, will, notwithstanding his impartiality,
still rank him in Mrs. Hogarth's mind as
one of her husband's most zealous and sincere
friends."</p>

<p>In nine years after the receipt of this letter, Mrs.
Hogarth died, bequeathing her property to her relation,
Mrs. Mary Lewis of Chiswick, by whose kindness
and friendship I am in possession of the manuscripts
which form the basis of the foregoing sheets, the
following most singular and curious print of "Enthusiasm
Delineated," etc. etc. etc.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<h4>ENTHUSIASM DELINEATED,</h4>

<p class="p1 pfs70">CONTRASTED WITH THE PRINT ENTITLED</p>

<p class="p1 pfs90">A MEDLEY;</p>

<p class="p1 pfs70">TO WHICH HOGARTH AFTERWARDS ALTERED THE PLATE.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p class="small">"Idolatry is not only an accounting and worshipping that for God
which is not God, but it is also a worshipping the true God in a way
unsuitable to His nature, and particularly by the mediation of images
and corporeal resemblances."&mdash;<span class="smcap">South.</span></p>

<p class="p1 noindent">Such was the opinion of Dr. South, and such the
opinion of Hogarth, when he designed this very
extraordinary print, the intention of which is to give
"a lineal representation of the strange effects resulting
from literal and low conceptions of sacred beings,
as also of the idolatrous tendency of pictures in
churches, and prints in religious books," etc. To
exemplify this, he has parodied the productions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
several eminent masters, whose works, having been
generally painted under the direction of cardinals,
popes, etc., are chiefly on religious subjects; and by
the artists absurdly attempting to represent what
are not properly objects of sight, that which they
intended to be sublime is rendered in the highest
degree ridiculous. To burlesque the idolatrous symbols
with which they have peopled their canvas,
place the popish doctrine of transubstantiation<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> in
its true point of view, unmask hypocrisy, and check
the progress of those enthusiastic delusions which
Bishop Lavington properly terms "Religion run
Mad,"<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> are the author's leading objects.</p>

<p>To effect these purposes, he has delineated what
we may fairly denominate a powerful preacher, who
from his countenance, and what is hinted at in the
scale of vociferation at his left hand, seems treating
his congregation with <em>a bull roar</em>. He may be considered
as either a Methodistical Papist or a Popish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>Methodist, for his shaven crown intimates that he is
a Jesuit; and the harlequin's jacket underneath his
gown denotes the versatility of his religious professions.
This Proteus of the pulpit poises a puppet
in each hand; that in the left represents the devil
grasping a gridiron; in his right he holds the triple
figure with the triangular emblem, by which Raphael
and some other painters have profanely presumed to
personify the Deity.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Exemplifying sacred mysteries by these absurd
theorems is surely open to the severest satire; and
to heighten his ridicule, the artist has, by adding
three legs to the triangle, rendered it a complete
trivet, and given to his jesuitical and theatrical declaimer
(who, as his text intimates, "speaks as a
fool") a pointed antithesis,&mdash;"If you do not believe
in this trivet, you shall broil on that gridiron."
Dangling on pegs around the pulpit, and to be exhibited
as there shall be occasion, are six other puppets,
copied from the absurd misrepresentations which
some of the old masters have made of Adam and
Eve, Peter and Paul, Moses and Aaron. Adam and
Eve are a little caricatured, but evidently intended
to hint at the dry designs of Albert Durer. Adam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
though naked, has the air of a first-rate coxcomb.
Eve, encircled with a zone of fig leaves, has neither
grace in her step nor dignity in her gesture. Peter,
displaying his ponderous key, and pulling off Paul's
black periwig, is copied from Rembrandt, and to him
referred in Hogarth's inscription. Paul, with a beard
of Hudibrastic cut and dye, being low of stature, is
elevated by high-heeled shoes, and armed with two
swords: that in his hand, massy as the weapon
wielded by John a Gaunt; the other, which, like the
dagger of Hudibras, might serve as its page, tucked
to his side.</p>

<p>Moses and Aaron, one bearing the tables and the
other an incense pot, are retreating to the other side.
The Jewish lawgiver's having made many ordinances
concerning food, may be hinted at by his being
crowned with a porridge pot; the two feet may
serve for horns. The bells on the hem of Aaron's
garments are sufficiently obvious, and, as saith Master
Thomas Goodwin, in his <cite>Civil and Ecclesiastical
Rites</cite>&mdash;"By the bells are typed the sound of his
doctrine."</p>

<p>The nobleman in a pew beneath, unquestionably
refers to some known character; but for whom it is
meant I am unable to determine. He may either
be a peer who was at that time very constant in
his attendance at the Tabernacle, or a wolf who has
found his way into the fold, and is prowling among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the lambs of the flock. His face presents the index
of a mind in which hypocrisy is united with another
passion, and is in an eminent degree characteristic.
The holy fervour<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> of the female, who, seduced by the
tender touches of an earthly lover, lets her celestial
model fall to the ground, is equally remarkable. A
ragged figure<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> in the same pew, dropping his tears
into a bottle, we know, by his rueful countenance, his
handcuffs, and the letter T marked on his cheek, to
be a repentant thief. A tattered and coal-black
proselyte at the foot of the reading-desk, inspired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>with the epidemical enthusiasm of the place, is embracing
the idolatrous image of her adoration, which
in colour is similar to herself.</p>

<p>As sculptors and painters have thought fit to denominate
a child's head, with duck wings, "Cherubin;"<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
Hogarth, to one of these infantine fancies, has
whimsically enough added a pair of duck's feet. The
well-fed figure in the desk may perhaps be meant
as an overcharged portrait of Whitfield. The fainting
female in the corner of the print was intended
for Mrs. Douglas of the Piazza, who, after a most
licentious life, became a rigid devotee, and was Sam.
Foote's original for Mother Cole. The Jew, with an
insect between his nails, has a fine air of head. On
the book open before him is a print of "Abraham
offering up Isaac."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The figures in the background it is not necessary
to enumerate: they are sighing, weeping, groaning!
The four most obtrusive convey a severe satire on
transubstantiation. A Turk looking through the
window, is evidently laughing at their absurdities,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>and thanking Mahomet that he has been early
initiated in the Koran. A dog, with "Whitfield"
on his collar, seated upon a hassock, and howling in
concert with the preacher, is admirably designed.</p>

<p>The figure of a pigeon impressed on the Methodist's
brain, is intended to intimate that if the Holy
Spirit gets into the head instead of the heart, it will
create that confusion of intellect described in the
mental thermometer which rises out of it, and which
is crowned by a dove on the point of a triangle.</p>

<p>Thus did this great artist express his "First
Thought," but afterwards erased, or essentially altered
every figure except two, and <em>on the same piece of
copper</em>: we find his variations so multifarious as to
render it nearly a new print, which he entitled</p>


<p class="p2" />
<h4>CREDULITY, SUPERSTITION, AND FANATICISM.</h4>

<p class="pfs70">A MEDLEY.</p>

<p class="p1 noindent">The preacher and the devil, except in a few
shadows added to a handkerchief, are left as in the
first state, and these are the only figures that are so
left; from them and the background it is positively
ascertained that the first and second engravings are
on the same copperplate. Raphael's strange symbol
of the Deity the artist has struck out, and in the
place of it inserted a witch upon a broomstick; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>stead
of the puppets representing Adam and Eve,
Peter and Paul, Moses and Aaron, we have Mrs.
Veale's ghost, Julius Cæsar's apparition, and the
shade of Sir George Villiers.</p>

<p>The nobleman, and lady dropping her deified
image in the pew beneath the pulpit, are discarded,
and a pair of vulgar and uninteresting characters put
in their room. The handcuffed felon is obliterated,
and his place supplied by two figures, one weeping,
the other asleep. The ragged woman hugging a
model is altered to the boy of Bilson; and on the
hassock, where was the howling dog, is a shoeblack's
basket, with Whitfield's <cite>Journal</cite> placed upon King
James's <cite>Demonology</cite>. The characters of cherubin and
seraph are changed; and though the duck's wings are
left, the legs are lopped off. In the place of the corpulent
and consequential clerk, the artist has inserted
a meagre and moon-eyed monster, with wings that
either grow out of his shoulders, or appertain to a
foul fiend planted behind him and acting as his
prompter. Mother Douglas is beaten out of the
copper, and in her room Hogarth has introduced Mrs.
Tofts and her rabbits, one of the popular impositions
of his own day. The smelling-bottle applied to recover
Mrs. Douglas from fainting, is with Mrs. Tofts
very properly changed to a dram glass. The Jew is
altered, and altered for the worse: the print of
"Abraham and Isaac," in a book before him, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
obliterated, and a knife inscribed "bloody," and laid
upon an altar, supplies its place. In the characters
of the common people of the congregation there are
several variations; the models which some of them
held in their arms are totally changed. The pigeon
in the Methodist's brain is discarded; in the place of
the inscription in the top division of the thermometer
he has inserted the Cock Lane ghost; and instead of
the glory, which in the "First Thought" crowned the
whole, we have the Tedworth Drummer, a tale which,
had it not given the subject for Addison's comedy,
would have been long since forgotten. On the scale
of vociferation and the chandelier, the names of
W&mdash;d and Romaine are only to be found in the
present state of the plate; in the scale of the
thermometer there are numerous alterations. In
"The Medley," the artist has made an addition, and
placed Wesley's <cite>Sermons</cite> and Glanville's book <cite>On
Witches</cite> as supporters to the Methodist's brain. To
do this, and introduce the rabbits on the foreground,
he has brought his work so near the bottom of his
plate as not to leave room for a title, which, with the
quotation from St. John, "Believe not every spirit,"
etc., is, in the present state of the plate, engraven on
another piece of copper.</p>

<p>Many little variations besides those I have noted
will appear by a comparison of the two designs; one
is worthy of particular attention. In the print of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
"Enthusiasm Delineated," the inscriptions on the
thermometer, etc., are evidently from the burin of
Hogarth; in the print of "The Medley," every inscription,
even those which in each impression contain
the same words, are the work of a writing engraver,
from which I am inclined to believe, that in the first
state the artist never trusted the plate out of his own
hands.</p>

<p>With respect to the comparative merit of the two
prints, I think of the "First Thought" what Mr.
Walpole in his <cite>Anecdotes</cite> asserts of the "Second,"
that "for useful and deep satire, it is the most sublime
of all his works." It forms one great whole;
and the skill with which he has appropriated the absurd
symbols of painters, and combined the idolatrous
emblems of Popery with the mummery of modern
enthusiasts, presents a trait of his genius hitherto
unknown; displays the powers of his mind on subjects
new to his pencil, and shows an extent of information
and depth of thought that is not to be found
in any of his other works.</p>

<p>In "The Medley" the artist has changed his
ground, attacked follies of another description, and in
the place of Enthusiasm introduced Credulity, Superstition,
and Fanaticism. In his management of them
he has shown much genius, and by his transition from
one object to another, and the many metamorphoses
of his characters, displayed a power of assimilating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
aptness of appropriating, and versatility of pencil
hardly to be paralleled, and proved that his invention
was inexhaustible. With all this, it must be acknowledged
that some of the local credulities which he has
there depicted were of so temporary and trifling a
nature, that even now they are hardly recollected by
any other circumstances than having been introduced
in this print.</p>

<p>Ten or twelve figures engraved on the background
are not in the "First Thought:" two of them, viz. a
crazed convert terrified by a lay preacher, are admirably
descriptive; but as to the residue of this half-price
audience, met together to be miserable, they add
to the number without much increasing the force,
destroy the pyramid, and hurt the general effect;&mdash;if
they are intended to stand on the floor, they are too
high; if on benches, too low. The effect of this
print is further injured by the alteration of the clerk.
In the first state, his ample breadth of face and black
periwig render him a leading character, and give him
the rank of principal figure. The thin-visaged,
hungry harpy in "The Medley" has no importance,
neither is there any principal figure in that print. A
little cherub Mercury, crowned with a postilion's cap,
and bearing in his mouth a letter directed to St.
Moneytrap, is an afterthought, and only to be found
in the second impression.</p>

<p>If I am asked what were the artist's inducements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
for making so many alterations, I can account for it
in no other way than by supposing some friend suggested
that the satire would be mistaken, and that
there might be those who would suppose his arrows
were aimed at religion, though every shaft is pointed
at the preposterous masquerade habit in which it has
been frequently disguised.</p>

<p>Considering the time that must have been employed
in beating out the old figures, the trouble of
polishing the copper, etc., it seems rather extraordinary
that he should not have wholly discarded
his plate of the "First Thought," and taken another
piece of copper for the second. It is probable that
the alterations were made by degrees, and before the
author was fully satisfied with his design, became
much more numerous than he had at first intended.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

TASTE IN HIGH LIFE.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The picture from which this print was copied,
Hogarth painted by the order of Miss Edwards, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>woman of large fortune, who, having been laughed
at for some singularities in her manners, requested
the artist to recriminate on her opponents, and paid
him sixty guineas for his production.</p>

<p>It is professedly intended to ridicule the reigning
fashions of high life in the year 1742. To do this the
painter has brought into one group an old beau and
an old lady of the Chesterfield school, a fashionable
young lady, a little black boy, and a full-dressed
monkey. The old lady, with a most affected air,
poises between her finger and thumb a small tea-cup,
with the beauties of which she appears to be highly
enamoured.</p>

<p>The gentleman, gazing with vacant wonder at that
and the companion saucer which he holds in his
hand, joins in admiration of its astonishing beauties!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Each varied colour of the brightest hue,</p>
<p class="verse">The green, the red, the yellow, and the blue,</p>
<p class="verse">In every part their dazzled eyes behold,</p>
<p class="verse">Here streak'd with silver&mdash;there enrich'd with gold."</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">This gentleman is said to be intended for Lord
Portmore, in the habit he first appeared at Court
on his return from France. The cane dangling from
his wrist, large muff, long queue, black stock, feathered
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chapeau</i>, and shoes, give him the air of</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse8">"An old and finish'd fop,</p>
<p class="verse">All cork at heel, and feather all at top."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The old lady's habit, formed of stiff brocade, gives
her the appearance of a squat pyramid, with a grotesque
head at the top of it. The young one is
fondling a little black boy, who on his part is playing
with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite</i> pagoda. This miniature Othello has
been said to be intended for the late Ignatius Sancho,
whose talents and virtues were an honour to his
colour. At the time the picture was painted he
would have been rather older than the figure; but
as he was then honoured by the partiality and protection
of a noble family, the painter might possibly
mean to delineate what his figure had been a few
years before.</p>

<p>The little monkey, with a magnifying glass, bag-wig,
solitaire, laced hat, and ruffles, is eagerly inspecting
a bill of fare, with the following articles <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
dinner: cocks' combs, ducks' tongues, rabbits' ears,

<p>In the centre of the room is a capacious china jar;
in one corner a tremendous pyramid composed of
packs of cards; and on the floor, close to them, a bill
inscribed, "Lady Basto D<sup>r</sup> to John Pip, for cards&mdash;£300."</p>

<p>The room is ornamented with several pictures;
the principal represents the Medicean Venus on a
pedestal, in stays and high-heeled shoes, and holding
before her a hoop petticoat somewhat larger than a
fig-leaf; a Cupid paring down a fat lady to a thin
proportion, and another Cupid blowing up a fire to
burn a hoop petticoat, muff, bag, and queue wig, etc.
On the dexter side is another picture representing
Monsieur Desnoyer, operatically habited, dancing in
a grand ballet, and surrounded by butterflies, etc.,
inscribed "Insects," and evidently of the same genus
with this deity of dance. On the sinister is a drawing,
denominated "Exotics," consisting of queue and
bag-wigs, muffs, solitaires, petticoats, French-heeled
shoes, and other fantastic fripperies.</p>

<p>Beneath this is a lady in a pyramidical habit walking
the park; and, as the companion picture, we
have a blind man walking the streets.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>
<p>The fire-screen is adorned with a drawing of a
lady in a sedan chair&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"To conceive how she looks, you must call to your mind</p>
<p class="verse">The lady you've seen in a lobster confin'd,</p>
<p class="verse">Or a pagod in some little corner enshrin'd."</p>
</div></div>

<p>As Hogarth made this design from the ideas of
Miss Edwards, it has been said that he had no great
partiality for his own performance, and that, as he
never would consent to its being engraved, the drawing
from which the print is copied was made by the
connivance of one of her servants.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Be that as it
may, his ridicule on the absurdities of fashion,&mdash;on
the folly of collecting old china,&mdash;cookery,&mdash;card-playing,
etc., is pointed, and highly wrought.</p>

<p>At the sale of Miss Edwards' effects at Kensington,
the original picture was purchased by the father of
Mr. Birch, surgeon, of Essex Street, Strand.</p>

FARINELLI, CUZZONI, &amp; SENESINO.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This dignified heroine and the two heroes&mdash;of a
class&mdash;</p>

<p class="center small">"By their smooth chins and simple simper known,"</p>

<p class="noindent">are here the representatives of "the majesty of Egypt,
a morsel for a monarch," and "the foremost man of
all this world;"<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> they were the three principal performers
in Handel's opera of <cite>Ptolomeo</cite>, performed in
the year 1728. There have been some suspicions of
its not being Hogarth's design, and from the characters
more than bordering on caricature, etc., I
once inclined to that opinion; but from the general
spirit of the satire, and the same figures being introduced
in nearly the same attitudes in the first print
Hogarth ever published (<a href="#Page_22">see p. 22</a>), there is little
doubt of its being his production.</p>

<p>The position (for it can hardly be called an attitude)
in which the painter has placed Farinelli, is fully warranted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>by the writer of a pamphlet, entitled <cite>Reflections
on Theatrical Expression in Tragedy, etc.</cite>,
published in 1755. These <cite>Reflections</cite> are admirably
contrasted by the exaggerated compliment with
which the author of the <cite>Divine Legation</cite> honours
the divine Senesino. The two quotations follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall therefore, in my further remarks on this
article, go back to the old Italian theatre, when
Farinelli drew everybody to the Haymarket. What
a pipe! what modulation! what ecstasy to the ear!&mdash;but,
heavens! what clumsiness! what stupidity!
what offence to the eye! Reader, if of the city, thou
mayst probably have seen in the fields of Islington
or Mile-End, or if thou art in the environs of St.
James's, thou must have observed in the park, with
what ease and agility a cow, heavy with calf, has rose
up at the command of the milkwoman's foot. Thus
from the mossy bank sprung up the divine Farinelli.
Then with long strides, advancing a few paces, his
left hand settled upon his hip in a beautiful bend,
like that of an old-fashioned caudle-cup, his right
hand remained immoveable across his manly breast
till numbness called its partner to supply its place,
when it relieved itself in the position of the other
handle to the caudle-cup, etc."&mdash;<cite>Reflections, etc.</cite></p>

<p>With respect to the other genius of Italian song,
Mr. Nichols very justly observes that his dignity
must have been wonderful, or the following passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
in Dr. Warburton's <cite>Inquiry into the Causes of Prodigies
and Miracles</cite> (printed in 1727) affords a most
notorious example of the bathos:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Observe," says he (p. 60), "Sir Walter Raleigh's
great manner of ending the first part of the <cite>History
of the World</cite>: 'By this, which we have already set
down, is seen the beginning and end of the three first
monarchies of the world, whereof the founders and
erectors thought that they never could have ended;
that of Rome, which made the fourth, was also at
this time almost at the highest. We have left it
flourishing in the middle of the field, have rooted
up or cut down all that kept it from the eyes and
admiration of the world; but after some continuance
it shall begin to lose the beauty it had, the storms of
ambition shall beat the great boughs and branches
one against another, her leaves shall fall off, her
limbs wither, and a rabble of barbarous nations enter
the field and cut her down.' What strength of
colouring! what grace, what nobleness of expression!
with what a majesty does he close his immortal
labour! It puts one in mind of the so much
admired exit of the late famed Italian singer!"

<p class="noindent">These curious rhymes, engraven under the original
print, in a degree describe the plot of the play, and
the characters of the performers in this religious
ceremony; for as such does Picart class a copy which
he has introduced in the fourth volume of his work,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
accompanied with the following explanation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Many other customs might find a place here, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>delight the readers by their comical singularity, but we
dare not crowd in too great a number of those trifles,
as not being properly religious ceremonies; which
therefore, till approved of by the church, or by the
governor of it, prescribed by ecclesiastical laws or
formularies, we shall omit, except two or three of the
most remarkable. The first is what the description
here annexed calls the breeding woman's oath,&mdash;a
custom not to be met with in other countries,&mdash;which
is so fantastical, or rather unjust, that it would be a
prejudice to the laws of England if we were to judge
of their equity by that practice. Suppose any of
these girls, which may be called amphibious (being
neither wives nor virgins), is found to be with child.
She does not, or will not, pretend to know the father
of this child. In order to free herself from the
trouble of maintaining it when born, she looks out
for some rich man, upon whom she intends to father
it. Generally they say she pitches upon some good
citizen, though she does not know him, or maybe
has never seen him. Then she goes before a Justice
of the Peace, summons the pretended father to
appear before him, and in his presence swears upon
the Bible, which the clerk holds to her, that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
owns and declares that such a one whom she has
summoned to appear is the father of the child. How
far the equivocal expressions and restrictions of that
oath may excuse her from perjury, let a good casuist
be the judge. However, the man thus named and
sworn to by this formality of law is obliged to pay
an arbitrary fine, and to agree upon a sum of money
for the maintenance of the child."&mdash;Picart's <cite>Religious
Ceremonies</cite>, p. 83.</p>

<p>The original picture from which this print was
engraven was one of Hogarth's early productions,
and is in the possession of the Rev. Mr. Whalley, at
Ecton, Northamptonshire. In the disposition of the
figures, etc., it has a more than accidental resemblance
to a picture by Heemskirk, which was in the
possession of Mr. Watson, surgeon, Rathbone Place,
where all the male figures are monkeys; all the
females, cats; and which in the year 1772 was engraved
in mezzotinto by Dickinson, and entitled
"The Village Magistrate."</p>

CAPTAIN THOMAS CORAM.</div>
</div>

<p>The artist has made his old friend Captain Coram
a principal figure; and as this excellent and venerable
man was in fact the founder of the charity, it is
with great propriety he is introduced. Before him
the beadle of the Hospital carries an infant, whose
mother, having dropped a dagger with which she
might have been momentarily tempted to destroy
her child, kneels at his feet; while he, with that
benevolence with which his countenance was so
eminently marked, bids her be comforted, for her
babe will be nursed and protected.</p>

<p>On the dexter side of the print is a new-born
infant, left close to a stream of water, which runs
under the arch of a bridge. Near a gate, on a little
eminence in the pathway above, a woman leaves
another child to the casual care of the next person
who passes by. In the distance is a village with a
church.</p>

<p>In the other corner are three boys coming out of a
door with the king's arms over it; as emblems of
their future employments, one of them poises a
plummet, a second holds a trowel, and a third, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>mother is fondly pressing him to her bosom, has in
his hand a card for combing wool. The next group,
headed by a lad elevating a mathematical instrument,
are in sailors' jacket and trousers; those on their
right hand, one of whom has a rake, are in the uniform
of the school.</p>

<p>The attributes of the three little girls in the foreground&mdash;a
spinning-wheel, sampler, and broom&mdash;indicate
female industry and ingenuity.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the scene here represented
is a painter's anticipation, for the charter was
not granted until October 1739, and this design was
made only three years afterwards; but the manner
in which the charity has been since conducted has
realized the scene.</p>

TERRÆ FILIUS.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The work to which this is a frontispiece was written
by Nicholas Amhurst, author of the <cite>Craftsman</cite>, and
published in the year 1726. The leading object of
this writer is to satirize the Tory principles of the
University of Oxford; but as the book does not
abound in subjects for the pencil, Hogarth has
selected a scene described in No. 33, published 8th
May 1721, which contains "Advice to all gentlemen
schoolboys, etc., who are designed for the University<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of Oxford." In the part which forms the subject for
this print, the writer thus cautions them:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have a particular regard how you speak of those
gaudy things which flutter about Oxford in prodigious
numbers in summer time, called 'Toasts;'
take care how you reflect on their parentage, their
condition, their virtue, or their beauty,&mdash;ever remembering
that</p>

<p class="center small">'Hell has no fury like a woman scorn'd;'</p>

<p class="noindent">especially when they have spiritual bravoes on their
side, to revenge their cause on every audacious contemner
of Venus and her altars.</p>

<p>"Not long ago a bitter lampoon was published on
the most celebrated of these petticoat professors. As
soon as it came out the town was in an uproar, and a
very severe sentence was passed upon the author of
this anonymous libel, to discover whom no pains were
spared. All the disgusted ill-natured fellows in the
University were, one after another, suspected upon
this occasion. At last, I know not how, it was
peremptorily fixed upon one, whether justly or not I
cannot say; but the parties offended resolved to
make an example of somebody for such an enormous
crime, and one of them (more enraged than the rest)
was heard to declare, 'that right or wrong, that impudent
scoundrel (mentioning his name) should be
expelled by G&mdash;; and that she had interest enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>with the President and Senior Fellows of his College
to get his business done.' Accordingly, within a year
after this, he was (almost unanimously) expelled from
his fellowship, in the presence of some of the persons
injured, who came thither to see the execution.</p>

<p class="center small">'Felix quam faciunt aliena pericula cautum'</p>

<p class="noindent">was the thesis pitched upon by the excluding doctors
for the under-graduates to moralize upon, in a public
exercise upon this occasion; and as it is a very wholesome
maxim, I leave it, my little lads, to your serious
meditation."</p>

<p>To the figures introduced in this print the original
artist has given a spirit worthy of Callot; and the
copy hereto annexed has been thought correct and
animated.</p>

THE SEPULCHRE.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It has been frequently and truly remarked, that in
either historical or serious subjects Hogarth did not
excel; but to prove that even in this walk he was
considerably above mediocrity, and that the reader
may be enabled to judge for himself, I have selected
the annexed print, which forms one compartment of
the altar-piece to St. Mary Redcliffe's, Bristol, for the
painting of which he received five hundred pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>The centre division, which is much the largest, represents
the Ascension. The rays emanating from
the ascending Deity, and beaming through the interstices
of the surrounding clouds, are tenderly and
brilliantly touched. In the foreground, St. Thomas
on one knee, with his hands clasped together, is
eagerly looking up with an expression of wonder and
astonishment. On the other side is St. Peter, in a
reclining posture. Near the centre, St. John, with a
group made up of the other Apostles, attentively
listening to the two men in white, who appeared on
this occasion. The background is on one side closed
with tremendous rocks; on the other, under the skirts
of low-hung clouds in the distance, appears part of
the magnificent city of Jerusalem, illuminated by a
flash of lightning, which, darting from a darkened
sky, casts a livid gloom over the whole.</p>

<p>The compartment on the right hand represents the
rolling of the stone and sealing the sepulchre in the
presence of the high priest; the exertion displayed
in this is happily contrasted by the tenderness and
elegant softness displayed in the companion picture
here copied, where the Marys approach the empty
sepulchre. The angel, speaking and pointing up to
heaven with an expression which explains itself&mdash;to
singular beauty, sweetness, and benevolence,
unites great elevation of character, and the native
dignity of a superior being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>The foregoing remarks, with some little variations,
are extracted from an article in the <cite>Critical Review</cite>
for June 1756, which, being written while the artist
was living, were possibly seen and approved by himself.</p>

<p>The writer concludes by remarking, that the purchasing
such a picture for their church does great
honour to the opulent city for which it was painted,
and is the likeliest means to raise a British School of
Artists; though it would be a just subject of public
regret if Mr. Hogarth should abandon a branch of
painting in which he stands alone, unrivalled and
inimitable, to pursue another in which so many have
already excelled.</p>

<p>From the "Sealing the Sepulchre" and this print
there are two large mezzotintos by J. Jenner. The
centre compartment has not been engraved.</p>

<p class="noindent">One of our old writers gives it as his opinion, that
"there are only two subjects which are worthy the
study of a wise man, <em>i.e.</em> religion and politics." For
the first, it does not come under inquiry in this print;
but certain it is, that too sedulously studying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
second has frequently involved its votaries in many
most tedious and unprofitable disputes, and been
the source of much evil to many well-meaning and
honest men. Under this class comes the "Quidnunc"
here portrayed; it is said to be intended for a Mr.
Tibson, laceman in the Strand, who paid more attention
to the affairs of Europe than to those of his own
shop. He is represented in a style somewhat similar
to that in which Schalcken painted William the
Third,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>&mdash;holding a candle in his right hand, and
eagerly inspecting the <cite>Gazetteer</cite> of the day. Deeply
interested in the intelligence it contains concerning
the flames that rage on the Continent, he is totally
insensible of domestic danger, and regardless of a
flame which, ascending to his hat,</p>

<p class="center small">"Threatens destruction to his three-tail'd wig."</p>

<p>From the tie-wig, stockings, high-quartered shoes,
and sword, I should suppose it was painted about the
year 1730, when street robberies were so frequent in
the metropolis that it was customary for men in trade
to wear swords; not as now (1803), to preserve their
religion and liberty from foreign invasion, but to
defend their own pockets from <em>domestic collectors</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">The two agreeable persons here introduced formed
part of a group in an unfinished picture painted by
Hogarth. They were some years since engraved on
two copperplates; but as I thought that was placing
still further apart the hands of those twain whom the
holy service of matrimony was soon to unite, I have
here brought them into one, and in this we are presented
with the bride and that useful agent of Hymen,
denominated a Matchmaker. We see nothing of the
bridegroom but his hand and arm; from which, the
countenance of the lady, and the character of the go-between,
we may fairly infer he is young, and regret
that the artist did not complete the trio, and place
him as a contrast to the antiquated virgin with whom
he is to be united. By the beauty spots on her
face, she wishes to conceal the ravages of time; and
from her laced lappets, cuffs, robings, and brocaded
silk, we may suppose she is rich. As to the share
which the venerable person who provides her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
a husband is to have for his reward&mdash;it depends upon
the bargain. I have been told that in this masquerade
matrimony, the master of the ceremonies, or lord of
the bedchamber (which the reader pleases), is paid by
both the contracting parties.</p>

<p>Some of my readers may possibly imagine that
the tribe of Matchmakers, like the race of wolves, is
extinct in England; but this is so far from being
the case, that there is now in the neighbourhood of
Piccadilly a regular office,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> where any gentleman

THE MAN OF TASTE.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The circumstance on which this print is built is thus
described by Dr. Johnson:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Pope published in 1731 a poem called <em>False
Taste</em>, in which he very particularly and severely
criticises the house, the furniture, the gardens, and
the entertainments of Timon, a man of great wealth
and little taste. By Timon he was universally supposed,
and by the Earl of Burlington, to whom the
poem is addressed, was privately said, to mean the
Duke of Chandos, a man perhaps too much delighted
with pomp and show, but of a temper kind and
beneficent, and who had consequently the voice of
the public in his favour. A violent outcry was therefore
raised against the ingratitude and treachery of
Pope, who was said to have been indebted to the
patronage of Chandos for a present of a thousand
pounds, and who gained the opportunity of insulting
him by the kindness of his invitation. The receipt of
the thousand pounds Pope publicly denied; but from
the reproach which the attack on a character so
amiable brought upon him, he tried all means of
escaping. The name of Cleland was employed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
an apology<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> by which no man was satisfied; and he
was at last reduced to shelter his temerity behind
dissimulation, and endeavoured to make that disbelieved
which he never had confidence openly to
deny. He wrote an exculpatory letter to the Duke,
which was answered with great magnanimity by a
man who accepted his excuse without believing his
professions. He said, that to have ridiculed his taste
or his buildings had been an indifferent action in
another man, but that in Pope, after the reciprocal
kindness that had been exchanged between them, it
had been less easily excused."&mdash;Johnson's <cite>Life of
Pope</cite>.</p>

<p>Soon after the publication of the poem alluded to,
Hogarth made this design, which presents a view of
Burlington Gate. On the front, as a crooked compliment
to the noble proprietor, he has inscribed the
word "Taste;" and as a standing proof of the projector
being entitled to the appellation, placed a
statue of his grand favourite William Kent triumphantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>brandishing his palette and pencils on the
summit, with two reclining figures representing
Raphael and Michael Angelo for his supporters.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
Standing on a scaffold board beneath them, Mr.
Pope, in the character of a plasterer, is whitewashing
the front, and whirling his brush with a spirit that
produces a shower of liquid pearl which dismays and
defiles the passengers beneath; the principal of these,
intended for the Duke of Chandos, holds his hat over
his head to shelter himself in his retreat. The torrent
is not confined to his Grace's person, but lavishly
scattered over his carriage and attendants, among
whom is a blackamoor in the way of being whitewashed.
The clergyman, whom I believe intended for
the duke's chaplain,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> is escaping round the carriage.</p>

<p>An old military character, who as well as the chaplain
is got out of the poet's vortex, is rubbing off the
stains which he has previously contracted.</p>

<p>Climbing a ladder reared against the scaffold, we
have Lord Burlington doing the office of a labourer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>and arrayed in a tie-wig, with a pair of compasses<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
suspended to the riband of his order, and carrying to
his little active workman a hand-hawk, on which is
a portion of what I am told the bricklayers call "fine
stuff," to mix up more whitening for beautifying the
front of his own gate, and defiling the garments of
every passenger. This, it must be acknowledged,
our poetical plasterer performs with distinguished
dexterity: he at the same time covers the corrosions
in the front, dashes a plenteous shower on those that
come near it, and so kicks the bottom of a pail which
hangs to his short ladder, that a copious stream flows
on the head of a gentleman beneath.</p>

<p>This double distribution of flattery and satire is
amply exemplified in the Epistle to Lord Burlington;
where the poet, by contrasting the feeble and imperfect
efforts of those he abuses with the superior and
superlative genius of the peer,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> elevates the powers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>of his own patron, and sinks those of all his competitors.</p>

<p>The print from which this is copied was prefixed
to a pamphlet, entitled <cite>A Miscellany of Taste</cite>, by Mr.
Pope, etc., containing his epistles, with notes, etc.
There are two other engravings from the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>

<div class="caption">
HENRY FIELDING.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This admirable writer was born at Sharpham Park,
in Somersetshire, near Glastonbury, April 22, 1707.
His father, Edmund Fielding, served in the wars
under the Duke of Marlborough, and arrived at the
rank of lieutenant-general at the latter end of George
<span class="fs80">I.</span> or beginning of George <span class="fs80">II.</span> He was grandson to
an Earl of Denbigh, and nearly related to the Duke
of Kingston, and many other noble families. His
mother was the daughter of Judge Gould, the grandfather
of Sir Henry Gould, one of the Barons of the
Exchequer.</p>

<p>Henry received the first rudiments of his education
from the Rev. Mr. Oliver, to whom we may judge he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>was not under very considerable obligations, from the
humorous and striking portrait given of him afterwards,
under the name of Parson Trulliber, in <cite>Joseph
Andrews</cite>. From Mr. Oliver's care he was removed
to Eton school, where he had the advantage of being
early known to many of the first people in the kingdom,&mdash;namely,
Lord Lyttelton, Mr. Fox, Mr. Pitt,
Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, and the late Mr.
Winnington.</p>

<p>At this great seminary of education he gave distinguished
proofs of strong and peculiar powers; and
when he left the place, was said to be uncommonly
versed in the Greek authors, and an early master of
the Latin classics: for both which he retained a
strong predilection in all the subsequent periods of
his life. Thus accomplished, he went from Eton to
Leyden, and there continued to show an eager thirst
for knowledge, and to study the civilians with unwearied
assiduity for two years; when, remittances
failing, he was obliged to return to London, not then
quite twenty years old.</p>

<p>The comedy called <cite>Don Quixote in England</cite>,
was planned at Leyden, and completed on his return
to London; where, from some cause or other, he
was induced to bring it on the stage before it was
properly wrought up, so that by this first essay he
gained no dramatic reputation. Nor were his other
productions for the playhouse much more popular;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
for though he wrote eight comedies and fifteen farces,
they have not generally proved what are termed
stock plays;<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and yet from several of them, particularly
<em>Pasquin</em>, succeeding and successful writers for
the stage have borrowed some of their best speeches.</p>

<p>He died at Lisbon, to which place he went for the
recovery of his health, in the year 1754, aged 47.</p>

<p>Of his talents, he has left memorials that will
never die while the English nation retains a taste for
genuine and Cervantic humour: his features posterity
would have only known by description, had not his
friend Hogarth, to whom he had often promised to
sit, made this drawing; for, singular as it may seem,
though this admirable writer lived on intimate terms
with the best artists of the day, no portrait of him
was ever painted.</p>

<p>Many strange stories have been told of the manner
in which the drawing was made, such as, the hint
being taken from a shade which a lady cut with
scissors; of Mr. Garrick having put on a suit of his
old friend's clothes, and making up his features and
assuming his attitude for the painter to copy, etc. etc.
These are trifling tales to please children, and echoed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
from one to another, because the multitude love the
marvellous.</p>

<p>The simple fact is, that the painter of the "Distressed
Poet," and the author of <cite>Tom Jones</cite>, having
talents of a similar texture, lived in habits of strict
intimacy; and Hogarth being told, after his friend's
death, that a portrait was wanted as a frontispiece to
his works, sketched this from memory.</p>

<p>The drawing was engraved by Mr. Basire, and is
said, by those who knew the original, to be a faithful
resemblance. This print is copied from a proof I
had from Mrs. Lewis, and taken before the ornaments
were inserted.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<h4>SIMON LORD LOVAT.</h4>

<img src="images/i_210_fp.jpg" width="450" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
SIMON, LORD LOVAT.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Simon Lord Lovat was born in the year 1667;
his father was the twenty-second person who had
enjoyed the title of Lovat in lineal descent. His
mother was Dame Sybilla Macleod, daughter of the
Chief of the clan of the Macleods, so famous for its
unalterable loyalty to its princes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>
<p>Buchanan relates a marvellous story of the family
at the battle of Loch Lochlie, 1544. In this battle
Lord Lovat, his four brothers, his three sons, and the
whole clan of the Frazers, were cut to pieces; but
if we are to believe this tale, the clan was afterwards
restored by a kind of miracle. The passage is
curious:&mdash;</p>

<p>"About this time, by the instigation, as it is
thought, of the Earl of Huntly, a battle was fought
in which almost the whole clan of the Frazers was
exterminated. There was an old quarrel between
the Frazers and the Macdonalds, which had been
rendered illustrious by the many bloody engagements
to which it had given birth. Huntly, in the
meantime, was deeply irritated that the Frazers alone,
among so many neighbouring clans, should reject his
protection. He had just collected the neighbouring
islanders, and made an incursion upon the estates of
the Earl of Argyll; and while every other clan had
exerted its whole force in his favour, there was
scarcely an individual in the whole clan of Frazer
that had not ranged himself under the enemy's
standard. For this time, however, the feud was composed
without an engagement; and the forces of
each party having disbanded themselves, returned to
the respective clans. The Macdonalds meantime, instructed
by the Earl of Huntly, collected their whole
force, and, having taken their enemy by surprise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>engaged in a most obstinate battle. The unfortunate
clan, overpowered by the greatest inequality of numbers,
were killed to a man. Thus a family the most
numerous, and who had often deserved well of the
Scottish weal, had wholly perished, unless, as it
seems just to believe, the Divine Providence had not
interfered in their favour. Of the heads of the clan,
eighty persons had left their wives pregnant at home,
and each of them in her turn was delivered of a male
child, who all attained safe to man's estate."&mdash;<cite>Buchanan</cite>,
lib. xv. p. 532. Pity but they had been twins!</p>

<p>Thus much may suffice for the character of his
progenitors; as to his own,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> he wrote a narrative in
French stating his conduct, connections, treatment at
the Court of St. Germains, etc. These memoirs,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>which are brought no further than the year 1715,
were translated and printed several years ago; but, for
some political or family reasons, not published until
1797. They contain many curious particulars of his
life, much of which, both then and in every subsequent
period, had great need of an apology. On his
tergiversation in the rebellion of 1745, Sir William
Young, one of the managers appointed for conducting
the prosecution, makes the following observations:&mdash;"Your
Lordships have already done
national justice on some of the principal traitors
who appeared in open arms against his Majesty by
the ordinary course of law; but this noble Lord, who
in the whole course of his life has boasted of his
superior cunning in wickedness, and his ability to commit
frequent treasons with impunity, vainly imagined
that he might possibly be a traitor in private, and
rebel only in his heart, by sending his son and his
followers to join the Pretender, and remaining at
home himself, to endeavour to deceive his Majesty's
faithful subjects; hoping <em>he</em> might be rewarded for
his son's services if successful, or his <em>son</em> alone be
the sufferer for <em>his</em> offences if the undertaking failed.
Diabolical cunning! Atrocious impiety!"&mdash;<cite>State
Trials</cite>, vol. iv. p. 627.</p>

<p>These are hard and heavy accusations; but the
fact is, that whoever becomes the biographical advocate
of Lord Lovat will find it useful to adopt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
plan recommended to the writer who wished to draw
a <em>fair character</em> of that <em>all-accomplished statesman</em>,
William Pulteney, Earl of Bath:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Leave a blank here and there, in each page,</p>
<p class="verse4">To enrol the fair deeds of his youth!</p>
<p class="verse">When you mention the acts of his age,</p>
<p class="verse4">Leave a blank for his honour and truth."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, his conduct previous to
execution was manly and spirited. When advised
by his friends to throw himself at his Majesty's feet
and petition for mercy, he absolutely refused, said
that he was old and infirm, and his life not worth
asking. When informed that an engine was to be
made for his execution like that called "the Maiden,"
provided long since for state criminals in Scotland,
he commended the contrivance, observing that, as
his neck was short, the executioner would be puzzled
to find it out with his axe; and if such a machine
were used, it would get the name of "Lord Lovat's
Maiden."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>When he was brought from Scotland to be tried in
London, Hogarth having previously known him, went
to meet him at St. Albans for the purpose of taking
his portrait, and at the "White Hart" in that town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
found the hoary peer under the hands of his barber.
The old nobleman rose to salute him (according to
the Scotch and French fashion) with so much eagerness,
that he left a large portion of the lather from
his beard on the face of his old friend.</p>

<p>He is drawn in the attitude of enumerating by his
fingers the rebel forces, "Such a general had so many
men," etc.; and I am informed the portrait is in air,
character, and feature, a most faithful resemblance of
the original.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<h4>NINE PRINTS FOR DON QUIXOTE.</h4>

<p>The first of these prints is copied from a plate in
Jarvis' quarto translation of this inimitable work;
it has neither painter nor engraver's name, but carries
indisputable marks of the pencil and burin of
Hogarth. The second is from an unfinished print in
my possession, which I think by the same artist. The
six which follow were designed for Lord Carteret's
Spanish edition, published in the year 1738; but as
they are etched in a bold and masterly style, I suppose
the noble peer did not think they were pretty
enough to embellish his volume, and therefore laid
them aside for Vandergucht's engravings from Vanderbank's
designs. Hogarth's six plates remaining
in the hands of Mr. Tonson, his Lordship's publisher,
were at his death bought by Mr. Dodsley, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
whom they were purchased by Messrs. Boydell, in
whose possession they now remain. While in Dodsley's
hands, references to the chapters and corresponding
pages in Jarvis' translation were engraved
under each.</p>

<p>The last scene, representing "Sancho's Feast," is
copied from an incomparable print engraved at an
early period of Hogarth's life, and published by
Overton and Hoole, price one shilling. The subject
of this is exactly consonant to Hogarth's genius, and
was probably selected by the artist to show how
happily he could enter into the spirit of a writer
whose turn of mind seems so congenial to his own.
Had Cervantes been an Englishman, I think he would
have contemplated our national follies through the
same medium that they were seen by Hogarth, and
probably selected similar scenes as subjects for his
satire. He lived in an age and country where one
gigantic folly</p>

<p class="center small">"In proud pre-eminence stalk'd through the land!"</p>

<p>He touched the phantom with his pen, and it
vanished; but as folly is in some cases the parent of
virtue, may not chivalry and romance, ridiculous as
they are in the eye of reason, give birth to an ardour
of spirit which aggrandizes and elevates a nation?
To a sedate and saturnine people, a spice of absurdity
may have its use, were it only to give motion to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
virtues which without it might stagnate. Divested
of that frenzy, which at the same time that it ruffles
and impairs their reason, awakes and rouses their
spirits, a whole nation, like a man-of-war becalmed,
may be undulated by ineffectual motion, until they
drop into a sort of mental stupor, unmarked by any
other distinctions than those that arise from stately
indolence, haughty solemnity, and supercilious dignity.</p>

<p>I will not presume to say that Spain is exactly in
this situation; but if it were, other causes may have
contributed to the change. If such are to be the
consequences of a nation's becoming wise, a tincture
of folly is rather to be desired than dreaded.</p>

<p>As to the hero of this admirable tale, the Knight
of the Sorrowful Countenance, who has been the
cause of more laughter than either the Knights of
Arthur's Round Table, or any other knights ancient
or modern, how can we sufficiently admire him! A
paragon of patience and perseverance, unconquerable
fortitude and proud honour, who in his lucid
intervals reasoned like a philosopher, and was invariably
actuated by the most exalted motives;
deemed himself bound to defend the weak against
the strong, chastise indolence, redress injuries, and
free those who were in bonds! That this ardent,
heroic, and dignified character, with motives so pure,
an heart so excellent, and virtues that elevate, adorn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and irradiate human nature, should be led by an
enthusiasm which fevered his imagination into absurdities
that expose him to derision, and, like Samson,
brought forth to make sport for the multitude, is
mortifying to humanity; and I must confess, that
with me, the laugh which the author's irresistible
humour invariably excites is accompanied by a pitying
sigh for the hero of this history, who is, after all,
so superlatively happy in his ideal importance, that
there is a degree of cruelty in destroying the illusion.
The adage, "You think you are <em>happy</em> because you
are <em>wise</em>; I think I am <em>wise</em> because I am <em>happy</em>," is
not easily confuted.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>But this admirable romance carries me further than
I intended. I was led into it by considering the
comparative merit of Cervantes and Hogarth, in
doing which, it is proper to observe that the motley
follies of England (diametrically opposite to those of
Spain) are changeable as an April day. Our English
moralist (for surely he is worthy of the title) transferred
them to his canvas or copper, and exposed
them by pointed ridicule.</p>

<p>But his satiric histories had a higher and still more
useful direction. They were calculated to encourage
industry, and promote humanity in the lower orders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
society, by exhibiting the baneful consequences of
idleness and cruelty; and to check the ostentatious
follies of those in a higher rank, by pointing out the
happiness attendant on the practice of virtue, and the
consequent misery of dissipation, sensuality, and vice.</p>

<p>I hope the warmest admirers of Cervantes will not
be offended if I venture to assert that these were
objects of more national and individual importance
than was the extirpation of knight-errantry.</p>

<p>Both these great men may be considered as universal
classics; for while Cervantes delights the
learned and the illiterate in his own country, and is
translated and eagerly read in France, Italy, Germany,
and England, while the artists of all these
nations emulate each other in delineating the scenes
he has described, and every age and rank peruse <cite>Don
Quixote</cite> with pleasure,&mdash;the fame of Hogarth is not
bounded by the shores of Albion, but takes as wide
a circuit through Europe, and his pictured stories are
contemplated with admiration by men of every
clime.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Could their congenial spirits witness the tribute
posterity pay to their talents, how would they be
gratified! Large as is their portion of fame, they were
little favoured by fortune. Hogarth, after a long life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of persevering industry, died comparatively poor.
As to the maimed hero of Spain, when the learned
Don Gregorio Mayans y Siscar, at the request of
Lord Carteret, collected materials for his life, he
could neither learn where he was born nor where he
died. Sevilla, Madrid, Esquivias, Toledo, Lucena,
and Alcazor de San Juan, contended for the honour
of his birth, whom living they had suffered to languish
in a prison.</p>

<p>He was born in Alcala de Henares, in the year
1547, and died at Madrid, April 23, 1616, on the same
nominal day with Shakspeare; so that Spain and
England lost their two great luminaries at the same
period, nor have succeeding centuries produced a successor
worthy of ascending either of their vacant
thrones.</p>

<p>From the similarity of their genius, it was reasonable
to expect that Hogarth would excel in delineating
the scenes described by Cervantes; and though our
great painter of nature succeeded better in subjects
drawn from the rich storehouse of his own mind than
in those described by others, yet in the portraits of
the knight, and knight companions, he has adhered
very closely to their leading characteristics, which are
thus depicted by Cervantes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The age of our gentleman bordered upon fifty
years; he was of a robust constitution, spare-bodied,
of a meagre visage, and a very keen sportsman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rozinanté was so long and lank, so thin and lean,
so like one labouring with an incurable consumption,
as did clearly show with what propriety his master
so entitled him. Sancho Panza, or Canzas, was so
called, because he had a great belly, a short stature,
and thick legs."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>To attempt a description of the nine following
prints in any other words than those of Cervantes,
would be absurd and vain; to suppose that the
greatest part of my readers had not perused <cite>Don
Quixote</cite>, would be an insult on their taste. I will
therefore take it for granted that the following scenes
are in their recollection. The few that have not read
this admirable romance have a pleasure to come; as
an inducement to their embracing it, I will insert
little more than a reference to the page in Shelton,
whose quaint old English has perhaps more serious
Cervantic humour than either Jarvis' or Smollett's
modern translations. My edition is that of 1675.</p>

a slight outline of the Don kneeling to receive his
new honours is discernible in the corner of the print.
Mine host, though a large man, is a less portly
personage than the author describes. This print is
not in any of the catalogues of Hogarth's works, but
the style leaves little doubt of the artist.</p>

<p>In the plate from Vanderbank, in Jarvis' quarto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>

<p class="noindent">The stern attention which our Don gives to the
Shepherdess Marcella, who is vindicating herself to
those that surround the corpse, well expresses his
determination to defend her cause, and protect her
from insult. The shepherd in a similar attitude to
the soldier in Vandyke's "Belisarius," and Sancho
blubbering with his finger in his eye, are well-imagined;
but the figure of Marcella is affected and
stiff, and the shepherd on her right hand has more
city pertness than rural simplicity.</p>

<p>Vanderbank has taken this scene for one of the
prints in Jarvis' translation, and by placing Marcella
where she ought to be, on the summit of the rock,
rendered his design more picturesque than Hogarth's.&mdash;<cite>Vide

carriers having terminated in his being most bountifully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>beaten, he is here represented in the hay-loft of
a very sorry inn, attended by the hostess and her
daughter, Maritornes, and his faithful squire; the
two former administering comfort to his sufferings,
the third holding a candle; and the last, with a most
rueful countenance, bewailing his own unfortunate
participation in the buffetings of his lord and master.</p>

<p>The picture which Cervantes draws of Maritornes,
Hogarth has well transferred to the copper. Thus is
she portrayed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"From head to heel she was not seven palms<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
high, and burdened with shoulders that forced her
to look down more than she wished. Added to this,
she was broad-faced, flat-pated, saddle-nosed, blind of
one eye, and could scarcely see out of the other."</p>

<p>The hostess could not have been better marked by
the pencil of Teniers; the owl perched over her head
should not be overlooked. That, as well as the rope
hung to a beam, cracked walls, etc. etc., added to the
miserable figure of the knight reclined on his hard
pallet, display variety of wretchedness. I do not
recollect to have seen a print in which the light is
more judiciously distributed; in this and every other
particular, I think it much superior to the same scene
designed by Vanderbank in Jarvis' quarto translation.&mdash;<cite>Vide

<p class="noindent">In this print the face and figure of the fierce knight
is spirited; the terror and astonishment of the discomfited

shout of Sancho in the distance admirably characteristic.
Notwithstanding this, I think that Vanderbank's
design for Jarvis, where the squire is brought
into the foreground, contemplating the glittering
prize, is a better chosen point of time. To Sancho
he has given a mixture of cunning and simplicity
which I have seldom seen so happily displayed; and
taken as a whole, it is perhaps a superior plate to
Hogarth's.&mdash;<cite>Vide Shelton</cite>, p. 42.</p>

valorous knight, after having unhorsed one of the

willing to bear his part in the adventure, helps to
extricate Gines de Passamonte from his bonds.</p>

<p>In this, as in some other of Hogarth's designs, the
artist not having taken the trouble of reversing his
drawing, the figures are left-handed. The character
of Sancho, and two or three of the slaves, is admirable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>
<p>I think the whole design much superior to Vanderbank's
in Jarvis' translation, where the scene is
chosen after the discomfiture of the Guards; for to
two or three of the thieves Vanderbank has given the
countenances of apostles. His whole print is tame,

DON QUIXOTE PLATE VII.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This interview, which took place in the mountains
of Sierra Morena, Cervantes thus describes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cardenio approached with a grave pace, and in a
hoarse voice saluted them with great courtesy. Don
Quixote returned his greeting with no less complaisance,
and pressed him strongly in his arms, as
if they had been long acquainted. The Knight of
the Rock, after he had been thus embraced, retreated
a few steps, and, laying his hand on the Don's
shoulder, perused his face with such earnestness,
as though he were desirous of recollecting if he had
ever seen him before, and no less admired Don
Quixote's strange figure than himself was admired
by our heroic knight-errant."</p>

<p>This is the point of time which Hogarth has
chosen; and the wild eye of Cardenio, the placid
benevolence of Don Quixote, and the shrewdness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of the goatherd, are well opposed. From the air,
attitude, and action of Sancho, I should have
imagined the period to be after he had been mauled
by the madman, did not the two knights so strongly
determine it to be before.</p>

<p>In Vanderbank's design of the same subject (<em>vide</em>
Jarvis' quarto), the figure of Sancho is tolerable, but
the Don is vapid and ill-drawn; and Cardenio's head,
like that of Medusa, looks as if it were encircled
with snakes.&mdash;<cite>Vide Shelton</cite>, p. 51.</p>

they trusted he might again live as an old Christian

procured an ample beard made from the tail of a
pied ox; and the curate assumed the habit of a distressed
virgin, and framed a tale of having been
wronged by a naughty knight, to punish whom the
Don was to be entreated to follow wherever this
afflicted fair one should lead.</p>

<p>The dressing-room for this masquerade is the

</div>

<p class="noindent">Though Don Quixote is the ostensible hero of this
admirable history, I have sometimes thought that
Sancho was the author's favourite character. He
is here represented as Governor of Barataria, and
seated in the spacious hall of a sumptuous palace,
surrounded with all the pompous parade of high
rank, and encircled by numerous attendants.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> A
band of musicians in an adjoining gallery strike up
a symphony to gratify his ear, and a table is spread
with every dainty to feast his eye and fret his soul;
for however magnificent the appendages of this mock
monarch, the instant he attempts to taste the solid
comforts of government, the loaves and fishes evade
his grasp, are touched by the black rod, and vanish!</p>

<p class="center small">"In plenty starving, tantaliz'd in state,"</p>

<p class="noindent">he curses the gaudy unsubstantial pageant, vows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
vengeance on the Doctor, and swears that he will
offer up both him and every physical impostor in
the island as a sacrifice to his injured and insulted
appetite.</p>

<p>Hogarth has here caught the true spirit of the
author, and given to this scene the genuine humour
of Cervantes. The rising choler of our Governor is
admirably contrasted by the assumed gravity of
Doctor Pedro Rezio. The starch and serious solemnity
of a straight-haired student who officiates as chaplain,
is well opposed by the broad grin of a curl-pated
blackamoor. The suppressed laughter of a man who
holds a napkin to his mouth forms a good antithesis
to the open chuckle of a fat cook. Sancho's two
pages bear a strong resemblance to the little punch-maker
in the Election Feast, and though well conceived,
might have had more variety; they present
a front and back view of the same figure. To two
females on the Viceroy's right hand there may be a
similar objection.</p>

<p>The original print was designed and engraved at
a very early period of Hogarth's life. As it was
finished with more neatness than any of the eight
which he afterwards etched for the same work, the
copy is attempted in a similar style.</p>

<p>In the drawing, Sancho was originally portrayed
with a full face; but Hogarth, judiciously thinking
a profile would be preferable, fixed a bit of paper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>over his first thought, and altered it to the state in
which it is here engraved.</p>

<p>The design that Vanderbank made from the same
scene is cold and uninteresting; in another by
Hayman, prefixed to Smollett's coarse translation,
Sancho is fat enough for Falstaff, and the Doctor
looks like a fellow dressed up to play the part of a
conjuror in a puppet-show.&mdash;<cite>Vide Shelton</cite>, p. 221.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The spirited sketch from which this is copied has
been thought the work of P. Mercier; but some of
my subscribers thinking it bore a strong resemblance
to Hogarth, I at their request submitted it to public
opinion. It arose from the following circumstance:&mdash;</p>

<p>The late Duke of Montagu invited Heidegger to
a tavern, where he was made drunk, and fell asleep;
in that situation a mould of his face was taken, from
which was made a mask; and the Duke provided a
man of the same stature to appear in a similar dress,
and wear it to personate Heidegger on the night of
the next masquerade, when George the Second (who
was apprised of the plot) was to be present. On his
Majesty's entrance, Heidegger, as was usual, bade the
music play "God save the King;" but no sooner
was his back turned, than the impostor, assuming his
voice and manner, ordered them to play "Charley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
over the Water." On this Heidegger raged, stamped,
swore, and commanded "God save the King." The
instant he retired, the impostor returned and ordered
them to resume "Charley." The musicians thought
their master drunk, but durst not disobey. The
scene now became truly comic. Shame! shame!
resounded from all parts of the theatre. Heidegger
offered to discharge his band, when the impostor
advanced and cried out in a plaintive tone, Sire, the
whole fault lies with that devil in my likeness. This
was too much: poor Heidegger turned round, grew
pale, but could not speak. The Duke, seeing it take
so serious a turn, ordered the fellow to unmask.
Heidegger retired in great wrath, seated himself in
an arm-chair, furiously commanded his attendants
to extinguish the lights, and swore he would never
again superintend the masquerade, unless the mask
was defaced and the mould broken in his presence.
For this purpose the man on his knee has a mallet
stuck in his girdle.</p>

<div class="caption">
MASQUERADE TICKET.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">As the first print which Hogarth published on his
own account, usually denominated "The Small Masquerade
Ticket," represents a large company eagerly
pressing to the door of a masquerade, we have here
the interior of the room crowded with a countless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>multitude of grotesque characters, celebrating the
orgies of the place, which, in the following references
engraved under the original print, are thus described:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>A</em>, a sacrifice to Priapus. <em>B</em>, a pair of Lecherometors,
showing y<sup>e</sup> company's inclinations as they approach
'em. Invented for the use of ladys and gentlemen
by y<sup>e</sup> ingenious Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;r" (Heidegger).</p>

<p>This titular divinity of the gardens being thus considered
as the god of their idolatry, his Term is
entitled to the first notice. The arched niche in
which it is placed is terminated by a goat's head,
ornamented with a pair of branching antlers, and
decorated with festooned curtains. Beneath is an
altar, the base of which is relieved with rams' heads
and flowers; and three pair of stags' horns are fixed
to the top.</p>

<p>As a companion to it, the united statues of a Venus
and Cupid, both of them masked, are placed on the
opposite side of the print. Cupid, who is a very
well-drawn and spirited little figure, "has bent his
bow to shoot at random," and Venus seems contemplating
the rise and fall of the mercury in one of
those instruments which the reference informs us is to
show the inclinations of all that approach it. The
niche in which these divinities are placed is not only
decorated with curtains, but crowned with cooing
doves. An altar beneath has on it three or four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
bleeding hearts, which, being close to the blaze, are in
the way of being broiled. On the base are queue-wigs,
bag-wigs, etc.</p>

<p>This may suffice for the presiding deities of the
diversion; the head of their high priest, the renowned
Heidegger, master of the mysteries and manager in
chief, is placed on the front of a large dial, fixed
lozenge-fashion at the top of the print, and I believe
intended to vibrate with the pendulum, the ball of
which hangs beneath, and is labelled "Nonsense."
On the minute finger is written "Impertinence," and
on the hour hand, "Wit:" which seems to intimate
nonsense every second, impertinence every minute,
and wit once an hour! The time is half-past one&mdash;the
witching hour of night; 1727, the date of
the year this print was published, is on the corners of
the clock.</p>

<p>Recumbent on the upper line of this print, and
resting against the sides of the dial, the artist has
placed our British lion and unicorn renverse (such, I
think, is the term in heraldry), lying on their backs,
and each of them playing with its own tail; the lion
sinister, and the unicorn dexter. The supporters of
our regal arms being thus ludicrously introduced,
may perhaps allude to the encouragement George the
Second gave to Heidegger, who at that period might
be said to</p>

<p class="center small">"Teach kings to fiddle, and make senates dance;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">and who, by thus kindly superintending the pleasures
of our nobles, gained an income of £5000 a year, and,
as he frequently boasted, laid out the whole in this
country.</p>

<p>Beneath is a framed picture of a Bacchanalian
scene; and on each side, shelves with pyramids of
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'jellies, sweatmeats'">jellies, sweetmeats</ins>, etc., inscribed "Provocatives." On
two labels placed before them is written, "Supper
below."</p>

<p>A pair of instruments, somewhat similar to the
mental thermometer in "The Medley," are fixed on
each side: on that next to Venus and Cupid is
written, "cool, warm, dry, changeable, hot, moist,
fixt;" on the other, "expectation, hope, hot desire,
extreme hot, moist, sudden cold."</p>

<p>The motley crew who make up the crowd it is not
easy to describe, for every one present assumes a
false character.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Here tottering old age essays to prance</p>
<p class="verse">With feeble feet, and joins th' imperfect dance;</p>
<p class="verse">There, supercilious youth assumes the air</p>
<p class="verse">And reverend mien which hoary sages wear.</p>
<p class="verse">'Tis thus, like Proteus, Folly joys to range,</p>
<p class="verse">Her name to vary, and her shape to change."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Here are priests of all persuasions&mdash;Brahmins,
friars, drones, monks, and monkeys not a few.</p>

<p>A figure of Time with his scythe, eagerly pressing
towards the altar with rams' heads, is arrested in his
course by a sort of slaughterman, with a mask, shaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
crown, and short apron, who violently grasps his wing
with one hand, and with the other lifts up a hatchet,
which with fatal force he aims at his head. For
sanctuary, this feeble figure lays hold of one of the
horns of the altar, but is frustrated in his attempt to
reach the steps by a bishop, who, with his sacrificing
knife, coolly stabs him to the heart; while a monkey,
in the habit of a chorister, holds a basin to catch the
blood, the fumes from which he snuffs up with ineffable
delight. This I apprehend to be a metaphorical
view of a prelate <em>killing Time</em> at a masquerade.</p>

<p>Next to this group is a Mother Shipton, hooking
on the arms of a clown; and near them a harlequin
endeavouring to draw the attention of a graceful
columbine from a turban'd Turk, who attempts to
seduce her from her party-coloured gallant. A
female, with the mask of a monkey's head, salutes a
nun in a black veil; and while an old Capuchin, with
the face of an ape, whispers soft things to a young
girl, a fellow somewhat like Tiddy-doll draws up her
head-dress to a point, like a fool's cap. A man in the
right-hand corner, solicitous to give a glass of wine to
one of the sisterhood, lifts up her veil for the purpose
of her drinking it.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<img class="drop-cap" src="images/dc_237.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capx">The two prints here given are selected as
two of the earliest avowed productions of
Hogarth. The allegory in both is somewhat
obscure; but the figures are in the manner of
Callot, and in a spirited and masterly style. They
were both published in 1721, and are a proof that
at this early period the admirable vein of satire
which he possessed was directed against the vices
and follies of the age.</p>

<p>In the first of them we see (to use an expression
of Mr. Walpole) "the Devil cutting Fortune into
collops," to gratify the avaricious hopes of the adventurers
in the South Sea Bubble; and persons ascending
the ladder to ride upon wooden horses; alluding
to the desperate game which was played by the
South Sea Directors in England in the year 1720,
to the utter destruction of many opulent families.
The little figure with his hand in the pocket of a
fat personage was supposed by Mr. Steevens to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
been intended for Pope, who profited by the South
Sea scheme; and the fat man to be meant for Gay,
who was a loser in that iniquitous project. Mr. John
Law, a native of Edinburgh, was the projector of this
bubble; and was also author of the famous Mississippi
scheme in France, by which he ruined thousands.
To escape popular vengeance he fled to Venice, where
he died in poverty in 1729.</p>

MASQUERADES &amp; OPERAS, BURLINGTON GATE.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This satirical performance of Hogarth, which is commonly
called "The Small Masquerade Ticket," is
supposed to have been invented and drawn at the
instigation of Sir James Thornhill, out of revenge,
because Lord Burlington had preferred Mr. Kent
before him to paint for George the Second at his
palace at Kensington; and the leader of the figures
hurrying to a masquerade, crowned with a cap and
bells, and a garter round his right leg, has been said
to be intended for that monarch, who was very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>partial to those nocturnal amusements, and bestowed
a thousand pounds towards their support. The
purse with a label "£1000," which the satyr holds
immediately before him, gives some probability to
the supposition.</p>

<p>The kneeling figure on the show-cloth, pouring
gold at the feet of Cuzzoni the Italian singer (who
is drawing the money towards her with a rake),
represents the Earl of Peterborough; and on the
label is written, "Pray accept £8000." Mr. Heidegger,
the regulator of the masquerade, is also
exhibited at a window, with the letter H under him.
Of the three figures in the centre of the plate, the
middle one is Lord Burlington, a nobleman of considerable
taste in painting and architecture. On one
side of him is Mr. Campbell the architect; on the
other, some artist now unknown. On a board is a
display of the words, "Long Room: Fawkes' dexterity
of hand." On the opposite corner is the
figure of Harlequin, pointing to a label, on which is
written, "Dr. Faustus is here." This was a pantomime
performed to crowded houses throughout two
seasons.</p>

<p>In this print all the figures have a strong resemblance
to those of Callot; and the follies of the town
are very severely satirized by the representation of
multitudes, properly habited, crowding to the masquerade,
opera, and pantomime; whilst the works of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
our greatest dramatic writers are trundled through
the streets in a wheel-barrow, and cried as waste
paper for shops; among these may be distinguished
Shakspeare, Ben Jonson, Dryden, Congreve, Otway,
Farquhar, and Addison. In the first copy of this
print, instead of Ben Jonson's name on a label, we
have "Pasquin, N<sup>o</sup> XI." This was a periodical
paper published in 1722-3; and the number specified
is particularly severe on operas, etc.</p>

<p>As a further illustration of the taste of the times,
the artist has given a view of Burlington Gate, with
a figure, I believe, intended to represent the then
fashionable artist William Kent, on the summit,
brandishing his palette and pencils, and placed in a
more elevated situation than either Michael Angelo
or Raphael, who, seated beneath, become the two
supporters to this favourite of Lord Burlington.</p>

<p>Some verses (and those not always the same) engraved
on a separate piece of copper are found under
the first impressions. For example, under the earliest
impressions of 1724:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"Could now dumb Faustus, to reform the age,</p>
<p class="verse4">Conjure up Shakspeare's or Ben Jonson's Ghost,</p>
<p class="verse">They'd blush for shame, to see the English stage</p>
<p class="verse4">Debauch'd by fool'ries, at so great a cost.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"What would their manes say, should they behold</p>
<p class="verse4">Monsters and masquerades, where useful plays</p>
<p class="verse">Adorn'd the fruitful theatre of old,</p>
<p class="verse4">And rival wits contended for the bays?"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Under another impression:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"Long has the stage productive been</p>
<p class="verse4">Of offsprings it could brag on,</p>
<p class="verse">But never till this age was seen</p>
<p class="verse4">A windmill and a dragon.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"O Congreve! lay thy pen aside,</p>
<p class="verse4">Shakspeare, thy works disown,</p>
<p class="verse">Since monsters grim, and nought beside,</p>
<p class="verse4">Can please this senseless town."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>I have been the more particular in describing this
plate, as it appears to have been the first which
Hogarth published on his own account, and respecting
which he pathetically says: "I had to encounter
a monopoly of printsellers, equally mean and destructive
to the ingenious; for the first plate I published,
called 'The Taste of the Town,' in which
the reigning follies were lashed, had no sooner begun
to take a run, than I found copies of it in the print-shops
vending at half price, while the original prints
were returned to me again; and I was thus obliged
to sell the plate for whatever these pirates pleased to
give me, as there was no place of sale but their shops.
Owing to this and other circumstances, by engraving,
until I was near thirty, I could do little more than
maintain myself; but even then I was a punctual
paymaster."</p>

<p class="noindent">This plate seems at once to represent the exhibition
of <cite>The Beggars' Opera</cite>, and the rehearsal of an
Italian one. In the former, all the characters are
drawn with the heads of different animals: as Polly
with a cat's; Lucy with a sow's; Macheath with that
of an ass; Lockit, and Mr. and Mrs. Peachum, with
those of an ox, a dog, and an owl. In the latter,
several noblemen appear conducting the chief female
singer forward on the stage; and perhaps are offering
her money, or protection from a figure that is rushing
towards her with a drawn sword.</p>

<p>Harmony, flying in the air, turns her back on the
English playhouse, and hastens towards the rival
theatre. Musicians stand in front of the former,
playing on the Jew's harp, the salt-box, the bladder
and string, bagpipes, etc. On one side are people of
distinction, some of whom kneel, as if making an
offer to Polly, or paying their adorations to her. To
these are opposed a butcher, etc., expressing similar
applause. Apollo and one of the muses are fast
asleep beneath the stage. A man is indelicately
seated under a wall hung with ballads, and showing
his contempt of such compositions by the use he
makes of them. A sign of the star, a gibbet, and
some other circumstances less intelligible, appear in
the background.</p>

<p class="noindent">This well-imagined series of plates was designed by
Hogarth, and engraved by himself, for the matchless
poem of Butler. Each plate is illustrated by an
appropriate quotation from the facetious satirist;
and as our ingenious artist formed his designs from
an attentive perusal of the poem, his engravings, and
the extracts selected under each of them, reciprocally
explain each other. "His 'Hudibras,'" says Mr.
Walpole, "was the first of his works that marked
him as a man above the common; yet," adds the
critic, somewhat too fastidiously, "what made him
then noticed now surprises us, to find so little humour
in an undertaking so congenial to his talents."</p>

<p>The original title ran thus: "Twelve excellent
and most diverting Prints, taken from the celebrated
Poem of Hudibras, wrote by Samuel Butler; exposing
the villany and hypocrisy of the times. Invented
and engraved on twelve copperplates by William
Hogarth; and are humbly dedicated to William
Ware, Esq., of Great Houghton, in Northamptonshire,
and Mr. Allan Ramsay, of Edinburgh."</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"What excellence can brass or marble claim?</p>
<p class="verse">These papers better do secure thy fame;</p>
<p class="verse">Thy verse all monuments does far surpass,</p>
<p class="verse">No mausoleum's like thy 'Hudibras.'"</p>
</div></div>

<p>Allan Ramsay subscribed for thirty sets, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
number of subscribers amounted to one hundred and
ninety-two. The original plates were afterwards
purchased by Mr. Philip Overton. They subsequently
passed into the hands of the late Mr. Robert
Sayer; and it is certain that Hogarth often lamented
the having parted with his property in them without
ever having had an opportunity to improve them.</p>

<p>In the first of these plates is a portrait inscribed,
"Mr. Samuel Butler, born 1612, Author of Hudibras,
died 1680." The basso-relievo of the pedestal represents
Butler's Genius in a car, lashing round Mount
Parnassus, in the persons of Hudibras and Ralpho,
Rebellion, Hypocrisy, and Ignorance, the reigning
vices and follies of the time. In the scene of the
Committee (Plate IX.), one of the members has his
gloves on his head. "I am told," says Mr. Steevens,
"this whimsical custom once prevailed among our
sanctified fraternity; but it is in vain, I suppose, to
ask the reason why." This doubt, however, has
since produced from a respectable divine an intimation
that he has frequently heard his father, who died
some years ago at an advanced age, notice the custom
of placing the gloves on the head at church as
not uncommon in cold weather.</p>

<p>In the earliest impressions of Plate XI., the words
"Down with the Rumps" are not inserted on the
scroll.</p>

<p class="noindent">Mr. Walpole, in his <cite>Catalogue</cite>, thus describes this
plate: "Booth, Wilkes, and Cibber, contriving a
Pantomime; a Satire on Farces."</p>

<p>Though the inscription engraved under it is sufficiently
explanatory, it may be added that Mr. Devoto
was scene-painter either to Drury Lane or Lincoln's-Inn
Fields, and also to Goodman's Fields Theatre;
that the ropes mentioned in the inscription are no
other than halters, suspended over the heads of the
three managers; and that the labels issuing from
their respective mouths convey the following characteristic
words. The airy Wilkes, who dangles the
effigies of Punch, exclaims, "Poor R&mdash;ch! faith, I
<em>pitty</em> him." The Laureate Cibber, who is amusing
himself with playing with harlequin, invokes the
muse painted on the ceiling: "Assist, ye sacred
Nine!" And the solemn Booth, letting down the
figure of Jack Hall into the <em>forica</em>, is most tragically
exclaiming, with an oath, "Ha! this will do."
At the same instant Ben Jonson's ghost is rising
through the stage, and insulting a pantomime statue
fallen from its base. Over the figure of Hall is suspended
a parcel of waste paper, consisting of leaves
torn from <cite>The Way of the World</cite>, <cite>Hamlet</cite>, <cite>Macbeth</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
and <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite>. A fiddler is seen hanging by a
cord in the air, and performing, with a scroll before
him, which proclaims, "Music for the What" [meaning
perhaps the "What d'ye call it"] entertainment.
A pamphlet on the table exhibits a print of Jack
Sheppard in confinement. A dragon is also preparing
to fly; a dog thrusts his head out of the kennel;
a flask acquires motion by machinery, etc. The
countenances of Tragedy and Comedy, on each side
of the stage, are concealed by the bills for <cite>Harlequin
Dr. Faustus</cite>, <cite>Harlequin Shepherd</cite>, <em>etc.</em></p>

<p>"The scene," says Mr. Walpole, "is the Committee.
On the table are the instruments of torture. A
prisoner in rags, half-starved, appears before them;
the poor man has a good countenance, that adds to
the interest. On the other hand is the inhuman
gaoler. It is the very figure that Salvator Rosa
would have drawn for Iago in the moment of detection.
Villany, fear, and conscience are mixed in
yellow and livid on his countenance; his lips are
contracted by tremor, his face advances as eager to
lie, his legs step back as thinking to make his escape;
one hand is thrust precipitately into his bosom, the
fingers of the other are catching uncertainly at his
button-holes. If this was a portrait, it is the most
striking that ever was drawn; if it was not, it is
still finer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>This Committee was first appointed, Feb. 25,
1728-9, to examine into the state of the gaols within
the kingdom; and the persons here represented
under examination were&mdash;Thomas Bambridge, then
Warden of the Fleet Prison, and John Huggins, his
predecessor in that office. Both were declared "notoriously
guilty of great breaches of trust, extortions,
cruelties, and other high crimes and misdemeanours."
It was the unanimous resolution of the Committee,
"That Thomas Bambridge, the acting Warden of
the Prison of the Fleet, hath wilfully permitted
several debtors to the Crown in great sums of money,
as well as debtors to divers of his Majesty's subjects,
to escape; hath been guilty of the most notorious
breaches of his trust, great extortions, and the highest
crimes and misdemeanours in the execution of his
said office; and hath arbitrarily and unlawfully
loaded with irons, put into dungeons, and destroyed,
prisoners for debt under his charge, treating them in
the most barbarous and cruel manner, in high violation
and contempt of the laws of this kingdom."
Bambridge was in consequence disqualified by Act
of Parliament; and he cut his throat twenty years
after.</p>

<p>It was also resolved, "That John Huggins, Esq.,
late Warden of the Prison of the Fleet, did, during
the time of his wardenship, wilfully permit several
considerable debtors in his custody to escape; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>was notoriously guilty of great breaches of his
trust, extortions, cruelties, and other high crimes and
misdemeanours, in the execution of the said office;"
and he was for some time committed to Newgate,
but afterwards lived in credit to the age of ninety.</p>

<p>The statute, which took place June 24, 1735, was
drawn up by our artist's friend Mr. Huggins, who took
for his model the eighth of Queen Anne in favour of
literary property. But it was not so accurately executed
as entirely to remedy the evil; for, in a cause
founded on it, which came before Lord Hardwicke
in Chancery, that excellent lawyer determined that
no assignee, claiming under an assignment from the
original inventor, could take any benefit by it.</p>

<p>Hogarth, immediately after the passing of the Act,
published this print with the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfs90">
"In humble and grateful acknowledgment<br />
of the grace and goodness of the <span class="smcap">Legislature</span>,<br />

not only the Professors of those Arts were rescued<br />

</p>

<p>The royal Crown at the top is darting its rays
on mitres, coronets, the Chancellor's great seal, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Speaker's hat, etc. etc.; and on a scroll is written,
"An Act for the Encouragement of the Arts of
Designing, Engraving, and Etching, by vesting the
properties thereof in the inventors and engravers,
during the time therein mentioned."</p>

<p>The plate was afterwards used as a receipt for the
subscriptions to his four prints of "The Election."</p>

<p>In 1767, three years after Hogarth's death, his
widow stated, in a petition to the House of Commons,
"that she was informed that a Bill was
depending in the House to amend an Act made in
the eighth year of the reign of his late Majesty, for
the encouragement of the arts of designing, engraving,
and etching: that her late husband was the
inventor, engraver, and publisher of various designs&mdash;moral,
humorous, and historical; the sole property
whereof was vested in him by the said Act for the
term of fourteen years; that her chief support arose
from the sale of her late husband's works; that, since
his decease, many persons had copied, printed, and
published several of those works, and still continued
to do so; and that the sale of those spurious copies,
both at home and for exportation, had already been
a great prejudice to the petitioner, and, unless timely
prevented, would deprive her of her chief support
and dependence; and praying that provision might
be made for vesting in her the property of her said
husband's works." The petition was thought reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>able;
and a clause was added to the Bill for "vesting
in, and securing to, Jane Hogarth, widow, the property
in certain prints."</p>

ROYAL MASQUERADE, SOMERSET HOUSE.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This very interesting scene, which may be dated
early in 1755, is thus anticipated by Mr. Walpole, in
a letter to Mr. Richard Bentley, Dec. 24, 1754:&mdash;"The
Russian ambassador is to give a masquerade
for the birth of the little great prince (the Czar,
Paul I.). The King lends him Somerset House: he
wanted to borrow the palace over against me, and
sent to ask it of the cardinal-nephew (Henry Earl of
Lincoln, nephew to the Duke of Newcastle, to whose
title he succeeded), who replied, 'Not for half
Russia!'"</p>

<p>The print abounds with real portraits of personages
of the first distinction, of whom several may be identified
by the following extract from the <cite>Gentleman's
Magazine</cite>, vol. xxv. p. 89:&mdash;"<em>Feb. 6.</em>&mdash;The Russian
ambassador gave a most magnificent ball at Somerset
House. His Majesty came a little after eight, dressed
in a black domino, tie-wig, and gold-laced hat. Her
Royal Highness the Princess of Wales was in a blue
and silver robe, and her head greatly ornamented
with jewels. The Prince of Wales was in a pink and
silver dress. Prince Edward in a pink satin waistcoat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>with a belt adorned with diamonds. Princess
Augusta in a rich gold stuff. The Duke (of Cumberland)
was in a Turkish dress, with a large bunch
of diamonds in his turban. A noble lady shone in
the habit of a nymph, embroidered over with stars
studded with brilliants to the amount of £100,000.
In short, the dresses of the whole assembly were the
richest that could possibly be devised upon such an
occasion; and the whole entertainment, particularly
the desert, was the most elegant that expense could
furnish. Few exhibitions of this kind have equalled
it,&mdash;none excelled it. The number of persons were
above a thousand."</p>

<p>The original painting formed part of the fine collection
of the late Roger Palmer, Esq., on whose
death it devolved, with the rest of a very ample property,
to his only sister, Elizabeth, wife of the brave
and benevolent Captain Joseph Budworth, who assumed
the name and arms of Palmer.</p>

RICH'S TRIUMPHANT ENTRY.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This plate represents the removal of Rich, and his
scenery, authors, actors, etc., from Lincoln's-Inn
Fields to the new house. The scene is the area of
Covent Garden, across which, leading toward the
door of the theatre, is a long procession, consisting
of a cart loaded with thunder and lightning, per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>formers,
etc.; and at the head of them Mr. Rich
(invested with the skin of the famous dog in <cite>Perseus
and Andromeda</cite>) riding with his mistress in a chariot
driven by harlequin, and drawn by satyrs.</p>

<p>Some indifferent verses, which accompanied the
original publication, allude to Walker and Hall, the
original Macheath and Lockit, and conclude thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"To the Piazza let us turn our eyes,</p>
<p class="verse">See Johnny Gay on Porter's shoulders rise,</p>
<p class="verse">Whilst a bright Man of Taste his works despise."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"Another author wheels his work with care,</p>
<p class="verse">In hopes to get a market at this fair,</p>
<p class="verse">For such a day he sees not every year."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>By the "Man of Taste," Mr. Pope was apparently
designed. He is represented in his tie-wig, at a dark
corner of the Piazza, amusing himself (not very delicately)
with the <cite>Beggars' Opera</cite>. The letter P is
over his head; his little sword is significantly placed,
and the peculiarity of his figure is well preserved.
The reason why our artist has assigned such an
employment to him, we can only guess. It seems,
indeed, from Dr. Johnson's <cite>Life of Gay</cite>, that Pope
did not think the <cite>Beggars' Opera</cite> would succeed.
Swift, however, was of the same opinion; and yet
the former supported the piece on the first night of
exhibition, and the latter defended it in his <cite>Intelligencer</cite>
against the attacks of Dr. Herring, then
Preacher to the Society of Lincoln's-Inn, and afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>Archbishop of Canterbury. Hogarth might
be wanton in his satire, might have founded it on an
idle report, or might have sacrificed truth to the
prejudice of Sir James Thornhill, whose quarrel on
another occasion he is supposed to have taken up,
when he ridiculed the translator of <cite>Homer</cite>, in a view
of "The Gate of Burlington House."</p>

<div class="caption">
THE GOOD SAMARITAN.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">These magnificent prints are placed among the early
productions of Hogarth, as the paintings from which
they are copied were completed in 1737; and in
1748 a small copy of the "Pool of Bethesda" was
engraved by Ravenet, as a frontispiece to Stackhouse's
Family Bible.</p>

<p>Mr. Walpole observes, that "the burlesque turn of
our artist's mind mixed itself with his most serious
compositions; and that, in the 'Pool of Bethesda,' a
servant of a rich ulcerated lady beats back a poor
man (perhaps woman) who sought the same celestial
remedy." To this I may add, that the figure of the
priest, in the "Good Samaritan," is supremely comic,
and rather resembles some purse-proud burgomaster,
than the character it was designed to represent.</p>

<p>In the "Pool of Bethesda" is introduced, as I was
assured by Dr. Ducarel, a faithful portrait of Nell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Robinson, a celebrated courtezan, at whose shrine
both Hogarth and the Doctor had in early life
occasionally paid their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">devoirs</i>.</p>

<p>On the subject of these two very fine prints, it will
not only be candid, but amusing and instructive, to
transcribe Hogarth's own unvarnished remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As I could not bring myself to act like some of
my brethren, and make the painting of small conversation
pieces a sort of manufactory to be carried
on by the help of background and drapery painters,
it was not sufficiently profitable to pay the expenses
my family required. I therefore turned my thoughts
to a still more novel trade, the painting and engraving
modern moral subjects, a field not broken up in
any country or any age. The reasons which induced
me to adopt this mode of designing were, that I
thought both writers and painters had, in the historical
style, totally overlooked that intermediate species
of subjects, which may be placed between the sublime
and grotesque. I therefore wished to compose pictures
on canvas, similar to representations on the
stage; and further hope that they will be tried by
the same test, and criticised by the same criterion.
Let it be observed, that I mean to speak only of
those scenes where the human species are actors;
and these, I think, have not often been delineated in
a way of which they are worthy and capable. In
these compositions, those subjects that will both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>entertain and improve the mind bid fair to be of the
greatest public utility, and must therefore be entitled
to rank in the highest class. If the execution is
difficult (though that is but a secondary merit), the
author has a claim to a higher degree of praise. If
this be admitted, comedy, in painting as well as
writing, ought to be allotted the first place, as most
capable of all these perfections, though the sublime,
as it is called, has been opposed to it. Ocular demonstration
will carry more conviction to the mind of
a sensible man than all he would find in a thousand
volumes; and this has been attempted in the prints
I have composed. Let the decision be left to every
unprejudiced eye; let the figures in either pictures or
prints be considered as players, dressed either for the
sublime&mdash;for genteel comedy, or farce&mdash;for high or
low life. I have endeavoured to treat my subjects
as a dramatic writer; my picture is my stage, and
men and women my players, who, by means of certain
actions and gestures, are to exhibit a dumb show.</p>

<p>"Before I had done anything of much consequence
in this walk, I entertained some hopes of succeeding
in what the puffers in books call the great style of
history-painting; so that, without having had a stroke
of this grand business before, I quitted small portraits
and familiar conversations, and, with a smile at
my own temerity, commenced history-painter; and
on a great staircase at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
painted two Scripture stories, 'The Pool of Bethesda'
and 'The Good Samaritan,' with figures seven feet
high. These I presented to the charity; and thought
they might serve as a specimen, to show that, were
there an inclination in England for encouraging historical
pictures, such a first essay might prove the
painting them more easily attainable than is generally
imagined. But as religion, the great promoter of this
style in other countries, rejected it in England, I was
unwilling to sink into a portrait-manufacturer; and,
still ambitious of being singular, dropped all expectations
of advantage from that source, and returned
to the pursuit of my former dealings with the public
at large. This I found was most likely to answer
my purpose, provided I could strike the passions,
and, by small sums from many, by the sale of prints
which I could engrave from my own pictures, thus
secure my property to myself."</p></div>

<p>While these pictures were in progress, it was
announced that "among the governors of St. Bartholomew's
Hospital was lately chosen Mr. William
Hogarth, the celebrated painter, who, we are told,
designs to paint the staircase of the said hospital,
and thereby become a benefactor to it by giving his
labours gratis." And a newspaper of July 14, 1737,
says, "Yesterday the scaffolding was taken down
from before the picture of 'The Good Samaritan,'
which is esteemed a very curious piece."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>Hogarth paid his friend Lambert for painting the
landscape in this picture; and to the imaginary
merits of his coadjutor, the <cite>Analysis</cite>, p. 26, thus bears
testimony: "The sky always gradates one way or
other, and the rising or setting sun exhibits it in
great perfection; the imitating of which was Claude
de Lorraine's peculiar excellence, and it is now Mr.
Lambert's."</p>

<p>Both pictures, which appear of an oblong square
in the engravings, in the originals are surrounded
with scroll-work which cuts off the corners of them,
etc. All these ornaments, together with compartments
carved at the bottom, were the work of Mr.
Richards. These the late Mr. Alderman Boydell
caused to be engraved on separate plates, and appended
to those above them, on which sufficient
space had not been left. Hogarth requested that
these paintings might never be varnished. They
appear, therefore, to disadvantage, the decorations
about them having, within these few years past, been
highly glazed.</p>

<p>"The Pool of Bethesda" has suffered much from
the sun; and "The Good Samaritan," when cleaned
about the year 1780, was pressed so hard against the
straining frame, that several creases were made in
the canvas.</p>

MARTIN FOLKES ESQ<sup>RE</sup></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This elegant scholar was a mathematician and antiquary
of much celebrity in the philosophical annals
of literature. In 1713, at the early age of 24, he was
elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1741
was elected President. Mr. Folkes was also an early
Member of the Society of Antiquaries, having been
elected in 1719-20; and his communications to both
societies were numerous and valuable. His knowledge
in ancient and modern coins was very extensive;
and the most important work he produced, was
<cite>The History of the English Gold and Silver Coin,
from the Conquest to his own time</cite>.</p>

<p>Algernon, the famous Duke of Somerset, who had
been many years President of the Society of Antiquaries,
dying February 9, 1749-50, Mr. Folkes, who
was then one of the Vice-Presidents, was immediately
chosen to succeed his Grace; and was continued
President by the Charter of Incorporation of that
Society, November 2, 1751. But he was soon disabled
from presiding in person either in that or the
Royal Society, being seized, on the 26th of September
the same year, with a palsy, which deprived him of
the use of his left side. On the 30th of November
1753, he resigned the Presidentship of the Royal
Society; but continued President of the Society of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>Antiquaries till his death. After having languished
nearly three years, a second attack of his disorder, on
the 25th of June 1754, put an end to his life on the
28th of that month.</p>

BISHOP HOADLEY.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This portrait is in grand style, though rather in the
French manner. The painting, and the plate engraved
from it by Baron, were carefully preserved in
the Bishop's family.</p>

<p>Dr. Benjamin Hoadley, a prelate of considerable
eminence, was born November 4, 1676; educated at
Catharine Hall, Cambridge; elected Lecturer of St.
Mildred, Poultry, 1701; Rector of St. Peter-le-Poor
in 1704, and of Streatham in 1710; King's Chaplain,
February 16, 1715-16; Bishop of Bangor, March 18
following; translated to Hereford in 1721, to Salisbury
in 1723, and in 1734 to Winchester, which he
held nearly twenty-seven years, till on April 17, 1761,
at his house at Chelsea, in the same calm he had
enjoyed amidst all the storms that blew around him,
he died, full of years and honours, beloved and regretted
by all good men, in the 85th year of his age.
Few writers of eminence have been so frequently or
so illiberally traduced; yet fewer still have had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
felicity of living till a nation became their converts,
and of knowing "that sons have blushed their fathers
were their foes." His useful labours, which will ever
be esteemed by all lovers of the natural, civil, and
religious rights of Englishmen, were collected in 1773,
in three folio volumes.</p>

<p>The Bishop had two sons: Benjamin Hoadley,
M.D., F.R.S., Physician to Frederick Prince of Wales,
and to George the Second; of high rank in his profession;
and well known by many valuable writings,
more especially by his comedy of <cite>The Suspicious
Husband</cite>. He died, in his father's lifetime, in 1757.
The other son, the Rev. Dr. John Hoadley, Chancellor
of Winchester, was also a most amiable man, and
an elegant poet. He was the editor of his father's
collected works, introduced by a well-digested biographical
memoir. He died March 10, 1776; and
with him the name of Hoadley became extinct. His
relict, who long survived him, possessed several
original paintings by Hogarth, which were afterwards
the property of the late Mr. Archdeacon D'Oyley.</p>

<div class="caption">
FALSE PERSPECTIVE.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Early in 1753, Hogarth presented to his friend Mr.
Joshua Kirby this whimsical satirical design; which
arose from the mistakes of Sir Edward Walpole, who
was learning to draw without being taught perspective:
an anecdote recorded by Mr. Steevens, on Sir
Edward's own authority.</p>

<p>To point out in a strong light the errors which
would be likely to happen from the want of acquaintance
with those principles, Hogarth's design
was produced.</p>

<p>A traveller is represented on an eminence, lighting
his pipe from a candle presented to him by a woman
from a chamber-window at the distance of at least a
mile. We are also astonished at the representation
near it, of a crow seated on the spray of a tree, without
incommoding by its weight the tender sprouts
issuing from its branches; and our astonishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
increases when we recollect that this tree, if weighed
in the balance with the bird, would hardly be found
to preponderate. The tree on which the feathered
animal is so securely stationed is, however, of a much
greater height and magnitude than those which are
nearer, and which gradually diminish as they approach
the foreground. The sheep, taking example from
the trees, are very large at a distance, but regularly
become minute by their proximity, the nearest being
almost invisible. Both ends of the church, the top,
and the whole extent of one side of it, are clearly
seen. To take the view which Hogarth has represented,
we must, at the same time, be above, at each
end, and in front of that parochial erection; but he
has not been so complaisant as to favour us with the
sight of the road on the bridge, which the vessel
seems determined to sail over, while the waggon and
horses appear floating on the other side. A fellow
in a boat, nearly under the bridge, is attempting to
shoot a swan on the other side of it; though, as he is
situated, he cannot possibly have a view of the object
whose destruction he pretends to be aiming at. The
waggon and horses, which are supposed to be on the
bridge, are more distant than the tree which grows on
the further side.</p>

<p>Many other absurdities are visible in this curious
perspective view, which are too obvious to escape
observation: such as the signpost extending to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>house at the distance of half a mile, and the remote
row of trees concealing part of the nearer sign of the
half-moon; the angler's line interfering with another
belonging to his patient brother, though at a considerable
distance from each other; and the tops and
bottoms of the barrels being equally visible.</p>

<p>The favour of this communication was gratefully
acknowledged by Kirby, who in 1754 prefixed it to
Dr. Brook Taylor's <cite>Method of Perspective made easy
both in Theory and Practice</cite>, with a dedication to
Hogarth, who subsequently furnished him with a
serious design for the plate which is described at
<a href="#FPP">page 132.</a></p>

THE FARMER'S RETURN.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The little drama by Mr. Garrick, in which this exquisite
frontispiece first appeared, was thus prefaced:
"The following interlude was prepared for the stage,
merely with a view of assisting Mrs. Pritchard at her
benefit; and the desire of serving so good an actress
is a better excuse for its defects than the few days in
which it was written and represented. Notwithstanding
the favourable reception it has met with, the
author would not have printed it, had not his friend
Mr. Hogarth flattered him most agreeably, by thinking
the farmer and his family not unworthy of a
sketch of his pencil. To him, therefore, this trifle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
which he has so much honoured, is inscribed, as a
faint testimony of the sincere esteem which the writer
bears him, both as a man and an artist."</p>

<p>The original drawing was given to Mr. Garrick,
and was in the possession of his widow during her
life.</p>

FRONTISPIECES TO TRISTRAM SHANDY.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">For this popular work of his friend Lawrence Sterne,
Hogarth furnished two frontispieces; one in 1759,
for the second volume; the other in 1761, for the
fourth.</p>

<p>The first of these is taken from the chapter in
which Corporal Trim is represented reading a sermon
to Tristram's father, Uncle Toby, and Dr. Slop, the
latter of whom is fallen asleep, and who was intended
for Dr. John Burton, a physician of great eminence at
York, well known as an able and industrious antiquary,
and also as a sturdy Jacobite.</p>

publish an exact account of the whole for the use of
students; but his work never appeared."</p>

<p>As this plate was found among others engraved by
Hogarth, it might probably have been one of his
early performances. His widow, in 1781, directed
a few impressions to be taken from it; which were

executed in the dotted manner then so much in

those excellent performances by Bartolozzi after the
drawings of Guercino; as spirit, rather than delicacy,
is the characteristic of our artist's shrimp-girl.</p>

<p>The public life of this great statesman is too well
known to need recital here. Let it suffice to say,
that in 1756 he resigned the office of Secretary at
War to Mr. Pitt; and in the following year was
appointed Paymaster of the Forces, which he retained
until the commencement of the reign of King George
III. May 6, 1762, his lady was created Baroness
Holland; and April 16, 1763, he himself was advanced
to a peerage, by the title of Baron Holland
of Foxley, Wilts. In the latter part of his life he
amused himself by building, at a vast expense, a

DEBATES ON PALMISTRY.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The figures employed in the study of palmistry seem
to have been designed for physicians and surgeons of
an hospital, who are debating on the most commodious
method of receiving a fee, inattentive to the
complaints of a lame female who solicits assistance.
A spectre, resembling the royal Dane, comes out
behind, perhaps to intimate that physic and poison
will occasionally produce similar effects. A glass-case
containing skeletons is open; a crocodile hangs
overhead; and an owl, emblematic of this sapient
consistory, is perched on a high stand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Steevens conjectured that this might have been
a repented effort of hasty spleen against the officers
of St. Bartholomew's, who might not have treated
some recommendation of a patient from our artist
with all the respect and attention to which he thought
it was entitled: but this is mere supposition.</p>

<p class="noindent">The humour in this print is not very striking. The
male staymaker seems to be taking professional
liberties with a female in the very room where her
husband sits, who is playing with one of his children
presented to him by a nurse, perhaps with a view to
call off his attention from what is going forward.
The hag shows her pretended love for the infant by
the mode in which she is kissing him. A maidservant
holds a looking-glass for the lady, and peeps
significantly at the operator from behind it. A boy
with a cockade on, and a little sword by his side,
appears to observe the familiarities already mentioned,
and is strutting up fiercely towards the staymaker,
while a girl is spilling some liquor in his hat.</p>

CHARITY IN THE CELLAR.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The original picture from which this print was engraved,
was painted for the late Lord Boyne. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>represents a convivial party assembled in a cellar
over a hogshead of claret, who, it is said, resolved
not to separate till they had drunk all the wine it
contained. Whether such a circumstance really gave
rise to the picture or not, it is unnecessary to inquire.
It is too well known that the habit of drinking to
excess, among all classes of society, existed at the
time of Hogarth to such a degree as to draw the
particular attention of this distinguished painter to
it; and it is not perhaps too much to say, that the
most distinguished preachers, or most able moral
writers, have not done more to drive this odious and
degrading vice from society than has been effected
by the valuable pencil of Hogarth. The individuals
here represented were members of a society well
known by the name of the "Hell-fire Club." In the
centre is the portrait of Sir Philip Hoby, seated on
the cask. Behind him, with his hand held up, is that
of Mr. De Grey, and below him is the portrait of
Lord J. Cavendish, who has drawn a spigot from the
cask to let the wine flow into a bowl. Opposite to
him Lord Sandwich is represented kneeling down to
draw in the intoxicating draught; and behind him
(extended on a form) is also Lord Galway. The
grouping of the four centre figures is an ingenious
imitation of a statue of Charity which is seen in the
cellar. The position of the bottles brings the comparison
still nearer, and is one of those little incidents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
for which Hogarth was so particularly distinguished
from all other painters, in omitting nothing that
might carry out his intention and make himself
understood.</p>

<p>The devotedness of this group to the object for
which they are assembled is extremely well portrayed.
The positions of the figures are easy, and
the principle of observing the pyramidal form (so
often insisted upon as necessary to beauty in the
grouping of figures) is here strikingly exemplified.
It is impossible to show a more unconquerable love
for the intoxicating draught than is expressed in the
portrait of Lord Galway. Unable to stand, he has
placed himself on his back in such a manner that the
liquor from the cask above him is flowing into his
mouth; and he has perhaps been represented by
Hogarth as thus persevering in the fatal habit, in
order to show the excess to which it was then carried,
and is a forcible point in the painter's composition.</p>

<p>The picture is now in the possession of the present
Lord Boyne, and the print from it, which we have
added to our present edition, is not to be found in
any other of the collected works of Hogarth.</p>

<p class="drop-capx">The following hints are offered principally with a view to
assist in identifying such characters in Hogarth's prints as
are unnoticed, or but slightly described, in the preceding
volumes. A key to the whole (for many of the figures
not yet recognised were undoubtedly meant by the artist
as portraits) would, to the other merits of these inimitable compositions,
add the important one of making them an assemblage of the similitudes
of the leading remarkables of his day.</p>
</div>


<p class="p2" />
<h4>SOUTHWARK FAIR.</h4>

<p class="pfs90"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51821/51821-h/51821-h.htm#Page_162"><span class="smcap">Vol. i.</span> P. 162.</a></p>

<div class="fs90">

<p class="noindent">Although Hogarth, from a fear of creating himself enemies, disclaimed
individual portrait in his compositions, particularly of characters in the
higher walks of life, he was evidently not so scrupulous in indulging his
satire when representing more familiar scenes; and accordingly his
"Harlot's Progress," "Four Times of the Day," "Industry and Idleness,"
"March to Finchley," etc., are found to be less peopled with
ideal personages than the "Marriage à la Mode," and some others.
"Southwark Fair" was an annual assemblage of remarkables, whose
follies and peculiarities he could hold up to the derision of the public
without the danger of retaliation; and he has availed himself of the
opportunity by bringing together a number of persons then well known
on the town, and placing them in the most ludicrous situations.</p>

<p>This Fair, the humours of which an ingenious author truly observes,
"will never be forgotten while Hogarth's inimitable print of it exists,"
was anciently called "Our Lady Fair," and lasted fourteen days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Like most others in the kingdom, it was originally established for the
purposes of trade; but having become in process of time a mere scene
of low riot and debauchery, its duration was shortened to three days;
and it was at length totally abolished as a nuisance to the neighbourhood,
and an encouragement to vice and dissipation. It was held at the top
of Blackman Street, on the open space opposite the walls of the King's
Bench prison, and began yearly a fortnight after Bartholomew Tide.</p>

<p>The following characters in this print have been identified, in addition
to others before noticed: Middle group.&mdash;The person whom the bailiffs
are arresting, and who is supposed to have been playing (not Alexander
the Great, but the part of Paris) in the <cite>Siege of Troy</cite> (announced for
representation on one of the neighbouring show-cloths), was intended
for Walker, afterwards the famous Macheath in the <cite>Beggars' Opera</cite>,
whose portrait it exactly resembles. It is introduced in this place with
strict propriety, as we learn that Walker kept a great theatrical booth
in Southwark Fair, as did Penkethman. "He also acted," says one
of his biographers, "in the same way at Bartholomew Fair, where
Booth saw him playing the part of Paris in the <cite>Siege of Troy</cite>."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The
painter probably placed him in the ridiculous situation we see him, on
account of his known extravagancy and consequent embarrassments,
which often procured him a visit from the bailiffs.</p>

<p>Figg, the prize-fighter, who in another part of the print is making
his triumphal entry on a blind horse, and brandishing his sword in
defiance, was a native of Thame in Oxfordshire, and attained so high a
celebrity as a master of the "noble science of defence," that we find
him praised in the <cite>Tatler</cite>, <cite>Guardian</cite>, <cite>Craftsman</cite>, and almost all the
periodical works of the time. The mezzotinto portrait of him by Faber
represents him exactly as here&mdash;with a bald head and open collar. His
own school was in Oxford Road, but he was probably accustomed to
exhibit his skill at fairs, or he may be introduced here merely as a well-known
character. The Bear Garden, a famous place for prize-fighting,
anciently stood in this neighbourhood, and had then been but recently
demolished. The manner of the combatants at this place, parading
the streets previous to their encounters, as described by a French
traveller in 1672, and the way in which Figg is represented, strictly
agree. "Commonly," says he, "when any fencing-masters belonging
to the Bear Garden are desirous of showing their courage and their
great skill, they issue mutual challenges; and before they engage,
parade the town on horseback, with drums and trumpets sounding, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
inform the public there is a challenge between two brave masters of the
science of defence, and that the battle will be fought on such a day."
Figg's public challenges were the very acme of bombast. This extraordinary
character died in the year 1734.</p>

<p>Miller, the tall man, whose effigies are exhibited on a show-cloth,
was a native of Saxony, and probably came into England in the reign
of George <span class="fs80">I.</span> This gigantic personage was eight feet high, the stature,
within a few inches, of the late O'Brien. He died in 1734, aged 60.
Boitard engraved a portrait of him the year before his death.</p>

<p>The two jugglers in senatorial wigs, who are displaying their magic
wonders with cups and balls, etc., seem to have been intended likewise
for two real characters (Fawkes and Neve), the Breslaw and Katterfelto
of their day. Fawkes is most certainly introduced in the print of
"Burlington Gate," where, on a board, the "Long Room" is announced,
and "Fawkes' dexterity of hand." Portraits of these
worthies still exist, and bear a sufficient resemblance to identify them
with their representatives in the plate. Neve in a wood print prefixed
to his "<cite>Merry Companion</cite>, teaching tricks in legerdemain;" and Fawkes
in a large sheet print by Sutton Nichols, where he stands in the midst
of his performances. Fawkes was no indifferent wit. When Breslaw,
a more modern performer of the same kind, was at Canterbury, the
former requested permission to display his cunning a little longer,
promising Mr. Mayor that if he was indulged with permission, he
would give such a night (naming a particular one) for the benefit of
the poor. The benevolent magistrate acceded to the proposition,
and he had a crowded house. Hearing nothing about the money collected
on the specified evening, the Mayor waited on the man of trick,
and in a delicate way expressed his surprise. "Mr. Mayor, I have
distributed the money myself." Still more surprised, "Pray, Sir, to
whom?" "To my own company; none can be poorer." "This is
a trick." "We live, Sir, by tricks."</p>

countenanced by the initials "B. C." on her bosom. This woman, by
a very natural transition, from being one of the most fashionable of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>

arrests and imprisonments, was buried from the poorhouse of St. Paul's,
Covent Garden, April 22, 1752. Fielding, in his <cite>Amelia</cite>, says: "It
is impossible to conceive a greater appearance of modesty, innocence,

<div class="fs90">

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Plate II.</span>&mdash;The commentators on Hogarth do not seem to have
assigned a satisfactory reason for the particular subjects of the two
paintings which ornament the Harlot's apartment in this plate, viz.
"David dancing before the Ark," and "Jonah sitting under a Gourd."
One supposes them merely intended to convey a ridicule on the old
masters, or placed here to satirize the impropriety of adorning rooms
with inappropriate subjects. Another, as stories selected at random,
but having a reference to the nation of the Harlot's Jew keeper. But
as Hogarth's incidents have all a meaning, a better reason must be
sought for. They undoubtedly conceal a moral applicable to the two
principal figures in the print. David's known breach of chastity in the
affair of Uriah's wife, and "uncovering himself" when dancing before
the ark, "in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the
vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself," which his wife charges
him with on that occasion, evidently typify the backsliding Jew; while
Jonah sitting under the shelter of his gourd, which sprang up in the
night, and which the worm destroyed in the morning, as ingeniously
points out the girl's upstart grandeur, and the frail nature of her pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>tection,
which even now a worm (her infidelity to her keeper) is rapidly
undermining.</p>

<p>Plate V.&mdash;Dr. Misaubin, or Mizenbank as Trusler calls him (the
lean doctor in this print), was a notorious foreign quack of the day,
whose ignorant consequence Fielding thus laughably exposes in one of
his introductory chapters in <cite>Tom Jones</cite>:&mdash;"The learned Dr. Misaubin
used to say, that the proper direction to him was, 'To Dr. Misaubin,
in the world,' intimating that there were few people in it to whom his
great reputation was not known. And, perhaps, upon a nice examination
into the matter, we shall find that this circumstance bears no inconsiderable
part among the many blessings of human grandeur."</p>

<p>Watteau painted the portrait of this Esculapius, from which a print
was engraved by Pond. The likeness strikingly resembles Hogarth's
representation, and is inscribed "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Prenez des pillules</span>." The similitude
of his opponent Dr. Rock, though not authenticated in the same manner,
is, from the testimony of those who recollect him, equally correct.</p>

<p>This "great man" is said to have been originally a porter; for which
his strong, squat figure excellently adapted him. An anecdote, in some
degree confirmed, is told of him, that passing one day by the end of
Fleet Market, with his gold-laced hat and cane, a brother porter, who
knew his origin, and was resting his load near the spot, said, "Dr.
Rock, you once carried a knot as well as myself." "Yes; and had I
been as great a dunce as you," replied the pill merchant, "I should
have carried a knot still."</p>

head is introduced in the place of a mutilated Cæsar. Pontac
was a celebrated purveyor at this time. In the "Hind and Panther"
transversed, Pontac's eating-house is mentioned with epicurean honours:</p>

<p class="noindent">It was chiefly frequented as a chop-house, but every other luxury might

<p>Plate VIII.&mdash;The maniac chained to the floor of his cell in this print
is noticed by Mr. Ireland as being a copy from one of Cibber's figures
over the gate of Bedlam. He might have added, that the person of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Rake himself, whose expression of madness Mr. Mortimer so much
admired, is, as to features, a copy of the companion figure over the
same gate. This plagiarism, if it may be so called, was to the credit
of Hogarth's taste; for with all his own amazing powers of expression,
he could scarcely have hoped to equal such inimitable representations.
Time, and an injudicious attempt, some years since, at restoration, have
wofully injured these masterpieces of Cibber's chisel.</p>

<p>It may be observed of this print (the inside of Bedlam), in addition
to what has been before said, that the scene portrayed is not only a most
faithful representation of those doleful regions, but that most of the
persons are certainly intended as real portraits. One at least may, with
every appearance of probability, be added to the list of names of those
already identified&mdash;the man sitting by the figure inscribed "Charming
Betty Careless," who is supposed to have gone mad for love. Such a
person was actually confined there for that malady some years previous,
whose history so exactly corresponds with Hogarth's representation,
and whom he must have remembered, that it can scarcely be doubted
but he had him in his eye. The portrait of the person alluded to is
thus described in a modern biographical work: "William Ellis.
Printed and sold by Sutton Nichols, in Aldersgate Street, Æt. 45,
1709." Sitting on the rails of Moorfields. Printed with his life and
character written by himself, etc. This poor maniac lost his reason
through love for his Betty, who seems to have been a real character.
Ellis is represented with a chaplet of laurel on his right, and a Cupid
drawing his bow on the left. Under the chaplet is inscribed&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Tell her I burn with noble vestal fire,</p>

stood to Hogarth for the sketch when he was with Fournier the drawing-master.
But this is impossible, as the prints in the receipt are

Henderson was born. A correspondent has assured us that he has

The view represents it correctly previous to its being rebuilt in its present
form, and exactly similar to a small copperplate delineation of it
over an old song, called "A Song in praise of Sadlers Wells," in which
its various amusements are described. The adjoining alehouse window,
in which we behold a group enveloped in their own smoke, is the "Sir
Hugh Middleton's Head," a sign still remaining. A celebrated knot
of drinkers and smokers actually met at this place about the period
alluded to, at the head of which was old Rosamond, the proprietor of
the Wells; and it is not improbable but that Hogarth might have
known and meant to satirize this fraternity. The portraits of these
gentlemen are still preserved in a large painting at the very same public-house,
under the name of the "Sadlers Wells Club."</p>

<h4>ENRAGED MUSICIAN.</h4>

<p class="pfs90"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51821/51821-h/51821-h.htm#Page_206"><span class="smcap">Vol. i.</span> P. 206.</a></p>

<p class="noindent">Cervetto, well known by the name of "Nosee," has been generally
supposed to be intended by the character of the musician; but there are
others who apply it to Dr. Arne; for though not a strict likeness of
that great composer, the figure and face bear so near a resemblance
(and he was extremely remarkable) as fully to authorize the application.
The known irritability of the Doctor in musical business might not
have been the only cause of Hogarth's placing him in this ludicrous
situation; his habits of intrigue, and singularly plain person, made him
so fair an object for caricature, that one of his portraits, printed with a
song of his composing, has ironically written under it, "Beauty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Virtue." This song, with the portrait, was eagerly purchased up, and
is now very scarce. Some years since Mr. Colman got up a little interlude
at the Haymarket Theatre from the idea of this print, called "Ut
Pictura Poesis, or the Enraged Musician," when the character of the
musician was purposely given to a performer who was thought in figure
and face to resemble Dr. Arne.</p>

<p class="noindent">This celebrated picture, which, at the time of first publishing the preceding
volumes, was in the possession of Messrs. Boydell &amp; Co., but
has since been in other hands, was advertised to be sold by auction,
with other effects, by Mr. Jacques, May 12, 1812, on the premises,
Great James Street, Bedford Row, and was to be seen by applying for
tickets for that purpose to the auctioneer.</p>

<h4>THE BEGGARS' OPERA.</h4>

<p class="noindent">In addition to the value of this print as a collection of portraits, it may
be observed that it contains the only known representation of the inside
of the Lincoln's-Inn Fields Theatre. This playhouse was opened under
the management of Betterton, with the comedy of <cite>Love for Love</cite>, which
had a very considerable run. The <cite>Beggars' Opera</cite>, however, was of still
superior attraction, and it carried all before it. After continuing open
with various success for several seasons, the Lincoln's-Inn Fields playhouse
finally closed, on the removal of the company to the new theatre
in Covent Garden, and the building (the exterior of which is still entire)
is now occupied as Spode's pottery warehouse.</p>

<p class="noindent">The clergyman preaching is supposed to represent Dr. Desaguliers.
But why Hogarth has assigned him this post of honour, does not appear.
This gentleman was the son of a French Protestant clergyman;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
was educated at Cambridge, and held the donative of Whitchurch, in
Middlesex. He was the first lecturer on experimental philosophy in
the capital, and published his lectures in two vols. 4to. He died at his
lodgings at the Bedford Coffeehouse, Covent Garden, Feb. 29, 1744,
and was buried, March 26, at the Savoy. He is spoken of as a man of
considerable talents, but possibly might have had a peculiarly inanimate
mode of delivering his sermons, which occasioned Hogarth's satire.
The original painting from which this print was engraved was lately in
the possession of the late John Follett, Esq., of the Temple, London.
It differs in some little particulars from the print.</p>

<p>1. W. Hogarth, engraver, with two figures and two Cupids,
"April y<sup>e</sup> 20. 1720." I have seen a print on which was written, in
Hogarth's hand, "Near the Black Bull, Long Lane." Of this card
there is a modern copy.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1721.</p>

<p>1. An Emblematic Print on the South Sea; W. Hogarth, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inv. et sc.</i>
Sold by Mrs. Chilcot in Westminster Hall, and B. Caldwell, printseller,
in Newgate Street. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;Printed for Bowles. <em>Third

engraved beneath the print.</p>

<p>2. The Lottery; W. Hogarth, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inv. et sculp.</i> Sold by Chilcot and
Caldwell, price 1s. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;Printed for Chilcot. <em>Third state</em>&mdash;For
Sympson. And in a <em>fourth</em>&mdash;For Bowles&mdash;"price 1s." is erased.
An explanation with references is engraved beneath.</p>

<p>The allegory of both these prints is obscure, but the figures are in
the manner of Callot, and in a spirited and masterly style.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1723.</p>

<p>Eighteen plates to Aubry de la Mottraye's <cite>Travels</cite>. Hogarth's name
on fourteen of them. As these prints have such references as are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
hardly intelligible, and as Mr. Nichols' numbers and mine do not
exactly agree, I have given a slight hint of the subject of each.</p>

<p>5. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vas mirabile ex integro Smaragdo, Genoæ, etc.</span></p>

<p>Tom. i. No. 9.&mdash;Tiara Patriarchalis Græca.</p>

<p>Tom. ii. No. 11.&mdash;Fodina Terrea Danmorensis.</p>

<p>Tom. ii. No. 14.&mdash;A Lapland Hut, with Reindeer, etc.</p>

<p>To this catalogue, I think we may add No. 13, Tom. i., and Tom. i.
No. 16, as well as the figures at the comers of Tom. ii. No. 26 <span class="fs80">A</span>,
and those in Tom. ii. <span class="fs80">C</span>, of which there is a modern copy under the
name of The Five Muscovites.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1724.</p>

<p>1. Seven small prints to the new <cite>Metamorphosis of Lucius Apuleius
of Medaura</cite>; printed for Sam. Briscoe, 12mo, 2 vols.; one of the
plates without Hogarth's name. The hints for these figures are taken
from the prints in a translation, 2 vols. octavo, printed for the same
bookseller in 1708. A most contemptible modern imposition sometimes
appears under the title of <cite>An Eighth Apuleius</cite>.</p>

<p>2. Masquerades and Operas&mdash;Burlington Gate; W. Hogarth, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inv.
et sculp.</i> <a href="#Page_22"><em>Vide</em> p. 22.</a> In the early impressions, the name of Pasquin,
No. 11, is inserted as a label on a book in a wheel-barrow, where we
have now Ben Jonson. Eight lines engraved on a separate piece of
copper are sometimes found under the first impression: they begin&mdash;</p>

<p class="center small">"Could now dumb Faustus, to reform the age," etc.</p>

<p class="noindent">Beneath them is, "price 1s." To the second impression&mdash;</p>

<p class="center small">"O how refined, how elegant we're grown!" etc.</p>

<p class="noindent">The print is sometimes found without any lines. In this Hogarth's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
name is inserted within the frame of the plate. To the copy there are
also eight lines, beginning&mdash;</p>

<p class="center small">"Long has the stage productive been," etc.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1725.</p>

<p>1. Five Small Prints for the translation of <cite>Cassandra</cite>, in 5 vols.
duodecimo; W. Hogarth, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inv. et sculp.</i></p>

<p>2. Fifteen Headpieces for the <cite>Roman Military Punishments</cite>, by
John Beaver, Esq., engraved in the style of Callot.</p>

<p>The Plate to chap. xvii., "Pay stopped wholly or in part," etc.,
differs from that sold with the set. At the bottom of the former, in
the book we read, "W. Hogarth, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">invent. sculpt.</i>;" the latter has,
"W. Hogarth, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">invent. et fec.</i>" The former has a range of tents behind
the pay-table. These are omitted in the latter, which likewise
exhibits an additional soldier, attendant on measuring out the corn,
etc.</p>

<p>A little figure of a Roman General in the title-page may possibly be
by Hogarth, though his name is not to it.</p>

<p>3. A Copy from Kent's Altar-Piece, <a href="#KEN"><em>vide</em> p. 23.</a> This was usually
printed on blue paper. In the original the word "<em>wings</em>" is terminated
with a long <span class="large"><em>ſ</em></span>. In a modern copy this error is corrected.</p>

<p>4. A Scene in Handel's opera of <cite>Ptolomeo</cite>. <em>Vide</em> p. 184. There is
a copy of the same size.</p>

<p>5. Booth, Wilkes, and Cibber, contriving a Pantomime.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1726.</p>

<p>1. Frontispiece to <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terræ-filius</cite>. <a href="#FPT"><em>Vide</em> p. 193.</a></p>

<p>2. Twenty-six Figures on two large sheets; engraved for a <cite>Compendium
of Military Discipline</cite>, by J. Blackwell. No engraver's
name.</p>

<p>3. Twelve Prints for <cite>Hudibras</cite>&mdash;the large set. In Plate <span class="fs80">II</span> (the
earliest impressions) the words, "Down with the Rumps," are not
inserted on the scroll. "Printed and sold by P. Overton, near St.
Dunstan's Church, in Fleet Street, and J. Cooper, in James Street,
Covent Garden."</p>

<p>Now printed for Sayer, Fleet Street.</p>

<p>A Print representing Hudibras and Sidrophel, and taken off in
colours, was in 1782 engraved by T. Gaugain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Seventeen Small Prints for <cite>Hudibras</cite>, with Butler's head. The
portrait is evidently copied from White's mezzotinto of John Baptist
Monnoyer. The same designs on a large scale, with some slight
variations, were engraved by J. Mynde for Grey's edition of <cite>Hudibras</cite>,
published in 1724. Hogarth has evidently taken the hints for
his figures, grouping, etc., from a small edition of this poem published
in 1710.</p>

<p>Copies are inserted in Townley's translation of <cite>Hudibras</cite> into French,
published in 1757.</p>

<p>Many of them were copied by Ross, with violent alterations, for
Dr. Nashe's splendid edition of <cite>Hudibras</cite>, published in 1795.</p>

<p>4. Cunicularii, or the Wise Men of Godliman in Consultation. A
burlesque on the Believers in Mrs. Tofts, the rabbit-breeder.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1727.</p>

<p>1. Music introduced to Apollo by Minerva; Hogarth, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fecit</i>.
Frontispiece to some book of music, or ticket for a concert.</p>

<p>2. Large Masquerade Ticket. <em>Vide</em> Frontispiece and <a href="#MAS">p. 230.</a> In
the earliest impressions, the word "Provocatives" has instead of <span class="fs80">V</span> the
open vowel <span class="fs80">U</span>. It was afterwards amended, but the mark remains.</p>

<p>3. Frontispiece to <cite>Leveridge's Songs</cite>; no engraver's name. Mr.
Molteno informs me he has seen an impression of this, with the sky
partly erased, and a player's ticket engraved in the place. The title-page
to this work is, I believe, also by Hogarth.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1728.</p>

<p>1. Head of Hesiod, from the bust at Wilton; for Cook's translation.</p>

<p>Rich's Glory, or his Triumphant Entry into Covent Garden. <span class="fs80">W. H.
E<sup>t</sup> SULP.</span> Contemptible!</p>

<p>Of this there is a modern copy.</p>

<p>3. The Beggars' Opera. The title over the print in letters disproportionably
large.</p>

<p>4. The same; the lines under it engraved in a different manner.
"Sold at the print shop in the Strand," etc.</p>

<p>5. A copy of the same, under the title of "The Opera House, or
the Italian Eunuchs' Glory," etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1729.</p>

<p>1. Henry Eighth and Anne Bullen; with lines by Allan Ramsay,
beginning&mdash;</p>

<p class="center small">"Here struts old pious Harry, once the Great."</p>

<p>2. The same plate without any verses.</p>

<p>There is a coarse copy, I think engraved on pewter.</p>

<p>The original picture was painted for the portico at Vauxhall.</p>

<p>3. Frontispiece to Miller's <cite>Comedy of the Humours of Oxford</cite>;
engraved by Vandergucht.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1730.</p>

<p>1. Two Prints for <cite>Perseus and Andromeda</cite>.</p>

<p>2. Gulliver presented to the Queen of Babilary; engraved by Vandergucht.
Frontispiece to Lockman's translation of <cite>John Gulliver's
Travels</cite>. A wretched design.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1731.</p>

<p>1. Frontispiece to Molière's <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Avare</cite>.</p>

<p>2. To <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Cocu Imaginaire</cite>; prefixed to Molière's Plays in French
and English.</p>

<p>3. Frontispiece to Fielding's <cite>Tom Thumb</cite>; engraved by Vandergucht.
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Grostesque, and good'">Grotesque, and good</ins>.</p>

<p>4. Frontispiece to Mitchell's <cite>Opera of the Highland Fair</cite>; engraved
by Vandergucht.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1732.</p>

<p>1. Sarah Malcolm, executed March 7th, 1732, etc.; W. Hogarth
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad vivum</i>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pinxit et sculpsit</i>.</p>

<p>2. An engraved copy of ditto.</p>

<p>3. Ditto mezzotinto.</p>

<p>4. Part graven and part mezzotinto.</p>

<p>5. Another copy, with the addition of a clergyman holding a ring.</p>

<p>6. A wooden cut in the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for March 1733.</p>

<p>7. A small copy from a small whole length, in the possession of
Josiah Boydell, Esq.</p>

<p>The first, Hogarth <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sculpsit</i>, is very scarce.</p>

<p>8. The Man of Taste. Pope with a tie-wig on.</p>

<p>9. The same in a smaller size; Pope in a cap. Prefixed to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
pamphlet entitled "<cite>A Miscellany of Taste</cite>, by Mr. Pope, etc." <a href="#MAN"><em>Vide</em>
p. 201.</a></p>

<p>10. The same, in a still smaller size, coarsely engraved.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1733.</p>

<p>1. The Laughing Audience. Subscription-ticket to the Rake's
Progress, and Southwark Fair, which were originally delivered to subscribers
at a guinea and a half.</p>

<p>The receipt was afterwards cut off. Of this print there is a coarse
copy.</p>

<p>2. Southwark Fair. The show-cloth, representing the Stage Mutiny,
is copied from an etching by John Laguerre. The paint-pot and
brushes, which Hogarth has added to the figure with a cudgel in
his hand, has been said to allude to John Ellis the painter; is it not
quite as probable that it alludes to Jack Laguerre?</p>

<p>3. Judith and Holofernes. Engraved by Vandergucht. Frontispiece
to the Oratorio of Judith, by William Huggins, Esq.</p>

<p>4. Boys Peeping at Nature. Subscription-ticket to the Harlot's
Progress. The receipt was afterwards erased, and the following receipt,
very neatly engraved, supplied its place:</p>

<p>"Received &mdash;&mdash;, 1737, half a guinea, being the first payment for five
large prints&mdash;one representing a Strolling Company of Actresses dressing
themselves in a barn; and the other four&mdash;Morning, Noon, Evening,
and Night; which I promise to deliver on Lady-day next, on receiving
half a guinea more."</p>

<p>"<em>N.B.</em>&mdash;They will be twenty-five shillings after the subscription
is over."</p>

<p>A modern copy of this receipt in aquatinta was published in 1781.</p>

<p>2. Another print on the same subject, with considerable variations,
designed as a receipt for Moses brought to Pharaoh's Daughter, and
St. Paul before Felix, for which he afterwards substituted the burlesque
Paul.</p>

<p>In one of Hogarth's <span class="fs80">MSS.</span>, introductory to his intended description of
his prints, I find the following notices of the pictures of the Harlot's
and Rake's Progresses:</p>

<p>"Mr. Rouquet's account of my prints finishes with a description of
the March to Finchley. The picture was disposed of by lottery (the
only way a living painter has any chance of being paid for his time)
for three hundred pounds; by the like means most of my former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
pictures were sold. Those of the Harlot's and Rake's Progress have,
it seems, been since destroyed by fire,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> with many other fine pictures,
at the country house of the gentleman who bought them.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> It is reported,
and very remarkable if true, that a most magnificent clock-work
organ, being left exposed to the conflagration, was heard in the midst
of the flames to play several pleasing airs."</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1733 and 1734.</p>

<p>The Harlot's Progress, in six plates.</p>

<p>Plate 1. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;Feet to the old woman. Shadow thrown by
one house upon another. London added to the letter the parson is
reading. Cross put in the centre of the margin, as indeed it is to the
second state of the five that follow.</p>

<p>Plate 2. The shadows on the black boy's drapery, etc. are so
sudden that he looks like a magpie. I have a copy of this print, of
the same size, and well engraved; the situation of the figures reversed,
with the strange variations of a shepherd and shepherdess, in the two
pictures that were of Jonah and David, in the original.</p>

<p>Plate 3. A sort of sugar dish placed near the punch-bowl, in the
first state, is in the second changed to a bottle. In a set of wretched
copies, possibly made from the original pictures, and exhibited at
Christie's in the year 1792, the woman dangling a watch is painted
without stockings.</p>

<p>Plate 4. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;Damages in the ceiling stopped up: shadow
added on the wall close to the hoop petticoat: the dog much blacker.
In a print in my possession, the cross is inserted before any of these
variations were made.</p>

<p>Plate 5. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;Dr. Rock's name inscribed on the paper:
cap of the woman near the dying figure lowered.</p>

<p>Plate 6. The mask on the bottle inscribed "Nants," has a most
ludicrous appearance. The shadows, especially that on the forehead of
the girl near the clergyman, are much heightened in the <em>second state</em>.</p>

<p>2. Rehearsal of the Oratorio of Judith.</p>

<p>Ticket for a Modern Midnight Conversation. The singers of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>different parts of bass, tenor, and treble, may be easily distinguished;
and it is worthy of remark, that the notes before them are in the same
key with the performers' voices. The receipt was afterwards cut off
the plate.</p>

<p>3. A Midnight Modern Conversation.</p>

<p><em>Second state</em>&mdash;The right hand and skirt of a man fallen on the
ground stronger shadowed, and the lines over a vessel in the corner
intersected.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1735.</p>

<p>1. The Rake's Progress, in eight plates.</p>

<p>Plate 1. <em>First state</em>&mdash;A book "Mem<sup>dum</sup> 1721, May 3d. My son
Tom came from Oxford. 4th, dined at the French Ordinary. 5th of
June, put off my bad shilling." <em>Second state</em>&mdash;The book erased to
insert the cover of a Bible as the sole of a shoe. The girl's face altered
for the worse. Woollen-draper's shop-bill omitted.</p>

<p>Plate 2. <em>First state</em>&mdash;"Prosperity with Horlots smile." <em>Second
state</em>&mdash;Altered to Harlots.</p>

<p>Plate 3. <em>First state</em>&mdash;Dated <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'June ye [e subscript]'">June y<sup>e</sup></ins> 24th, 1735. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;June
25th, and a laced hat put on the head of the girl sitting next to the
Rake. Pontac's head introduced in the place of a mutilated Cæsar.</p>

<p>Plate 4. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;Shoeblack stealing the cane, erased, and his
place supplied by a group of gambling boys. This design is unquestionably
much improved by the alterations.</p>

<p>Plate 5. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;The right foot of the bridegroom, which
gave a tottering awkwardness to the figure, omitted. The maidservant's
face altered. The hand of the figure looking out of the gallery
blackened. In this print the artist has introduced a portrait of his
favourite dog Trump.</p>

<p>Plate 6. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;Rays round the candle stronger.</p>

<p>In the original sketch, the principal figure was not, as now, upon his
knees, but seated.</p>

<p>Plate 7. In the very earliest impressions, Plate 7 is not inserted in
the margin.</p>

<p>Plate 8. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;Head of the woman with a fan altered,
and affectedly turning away from the mad monarch. A halfpenny,
with a figure of Britannia, 1763, fixed against the wall, to intimate
what the artist thought the state of the nation. "Retouch'd by the
author, 1763."</p>

<p>It should seem that the man sitting by the figure inscribed "Charm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>ing
Betty Careless," went mad for love. Dr. Monro, I am told, asserts
that not more than one or two men have become mad from love in the
course of a hundred years. Shakspeare has not, as I recollect, drawn
one <em>man</em> mad from that cause. I find by Hogarth's memorandum
that the original pictures were sold to Francis Beckford, Esq., for
£184, 16s.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1736.</p>

<p>1. Two prints of Before and After. <a href="#Page_26">See p. 26.</a></p>

<p>2. The Sleeping Congregation.</p>

<p><em>First state</em>&mdash;"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dieu et mon droit</span>," under the king's arms, not inserted:
the angel has a pipe in his mouth. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;The above
motto added, the angel's pipe effaced, and the lines of the triangle
doubled. <em>Third state</em>&mdash;Inscribed on the side of the print: "Retouched
and improved, April 21, 1762, by the author."</p>

<p>3. The Distressed Poet.</p>

<p><em>First state</em>&mdash;Pope thrashing Curl, and four lines from the <cite>Dunciad</cite>
inscribed under the print. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;In the place of Pope, etc.,
view of the gold mines of Peru; and the four lines from the <cite>Dunciad</cite>
erased. This has been conjectured to be a portrait of Lewis Theobald,
and in 1794 a copy of the head with his name annexed to it was
published for Richardson. The original picture is in the collection of
Lord Grosvenor.</p>

<p>4. Right Honourable Frances Lady Byron.</p>

<p>Whole-length mezzotinto by Faber. The best impressions are
usually in brown ink. The plate was afterwards cut down to a half-length.</p>

<p>5. Arms of the Undertakers' Company.</p>

<p>The three figures at top are Dr. Ward, Chevalier Taylor, and Mrs.
Mapp, the bone-setter; though it has been said, that the figure supposed
to be Mrs. Mapp was intended for Sir Hans Sloane. <em>First state</em>&mdash;"One
compleat Docter," etc. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;The spelling corrected.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1737.</p>

<p>1. The Lecture, "Datur vacuum." In the early impressions, the
words "datur vacuum" are not printed. Hogarth sometimes wrote
them in with a pen.</p>

<p>Æneas in a Storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1738.</p>

<p>1. The four parts of the Day.</p>

<p>Morning. The sky singularly muddy to express snow. The figure
of the shivering boy was, in 1739, copied by F. Sykes, and is strangely
enough christened by collectors, The Half-starved Boy.</p>

<p>Noon. In the <em>second state</em>&mdash;Shadows heightened.</p>

<p>Evening. In early impressions the man's hands are printed in blue,
and the woman's face and neck in red; but they have been sometimes
so stamped in later impressions, where the rail-post is crossed
with intersecting lines, and the clearness of the water much injured.</p>

<p>In Hogarth's first design (engraved by Baron), the little girl with the
fan was omitted; but the artist thinking his delineation would be
improved by it, afterwards inserted it with his own burin. I have
seen three impressions in this state; one of them, then thought to be
unique, was purchased at Greenwood's Rooms, at Mr. Gulston's sale,
by Mr. Thane, for the late Mr. G. Stevens, at the price of £47.</p>

<p>Night. The Salisbury flying coach has been thought to be a burlesque
on a late noble peer, who delighted in driving his own horses.</p>

<p>I find by Hogarth's memorandum, that Sir William Heathcote purchased
the picture of Morning for twenty guineas, and that of Night
for £27, 6s. Noon was sold for £38, 17s., and Evening for £39, 18s.,
to the Duke of Ancaster.</p>

<p>2. Strolling Actresses dressing in a Barn.</p>

<p><em>Second state</em>&mdash;The woman holding a cat has her coiffure lowered,
and the female greasing her hair with a candle is divested of her
feathers. Head of the sable goddess Night blacker, and her hair
more woolly. Damages in the roof of the barn repaired; all the
shallows darker.</p>

<p>By an account in one of Hogarth's books, the original picture was
first sold to Francis Beckford, Esq., for £27, 6s. By him, though at
so low a price, returned! and afterwards sold for the same sum to Mr.
Wood of Littleton, in whose possession it still remains.</p>

<p>Mr. Cricket has an impression, taken before the man blowing a
horn, cats, steeple, play-bill, or drag were introduced. In this very
curious, and I believe unique print, the dustman is without a nose, the
chimney-sweeper has a grenadier's cap on, and a doll is placed under
the trap, composed of bricks, etc.</p>

<p>In the early impressions, the horse's head is white; in its present
state, black: and the dog, drag, hatchet, etc. considerably darker
than when first engraved.</p>

<p>"Received April &mdash;&mdash;, of &mdash;&mdash;, half a guinea, being the first payment
for six prints called Marriage à la Mode, which I promise to
deliver when finished, on receiving half a guinea more.</p>

<p>"<em>N.B.</em>&mdash;The price will be one guinea and an half after the time of
subscribing."</p>

<p>On this print Hogarth makes the following remark:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Being perpetually plagued, from the mistakes made among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
illiterate, by the similitude in the sound of the words <em>character</em> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caricatura</i>, I, ten years ago, endeavoured to explain the distinction by
the above print; and as I was then publishing Marriage à la Mode,
wherein were characters of high life, I introduced the great number
of faces there delineated (none of which are exaggerated), varied at
random, to prevent, if possible, personal application when the prints
should come out.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseqx">'We neither this nor that Sir Fopling call,</p>
<p class="verse">He's knight o' th' shire, and represents you all.'</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">This, however, did not prevent a likeness being found for each head, for
a general character will always bear some resemblance to a particular
one."</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1745.</p>

<p>1. Marriage à la Mode, in six plates.</p>

<p>Plate 1. The coronet impressed on the dog in the print is not in
the picture. I have this series of prints in the state they were left by
the original engravers, and all of them, though delicately engraved, are
in some degree spotty. In the <em>second state</em> of Plate 1, there are evident
marks of the burin of Hogarth in the faces of the Citizen and Peer;
and each of the characters, especially the latter, is improved. The
French portrait he has designedly thrown more out of harmony than
it was at first; the fringe to the canopy over the nobleman is much
darker; a shadow thrown on the building seen out of the window, and
on the light parts of the two dogs. <em>Third state</em>&mdash;All the shadows
blacker. Engraved by G. Scotin. Guido's Judith, which forms the
subject of one of the pictures, Hogarth copied from a print engraved
by Dupuis.</p>

<p>Plate 2. <em>First state</em>&mdash;A lock of hair on the forehead of the lady,
generally inserted with Indian ink, but sometimes left without. <em>Second
state</em>&mdash;Lock of hair engraved, and shadows on the carpet, etc. stronger.
Engraved by B. Baron.</p>

<p>Plate 3. In the original picture, an alembic under the table is seen
through the cloth. In the <em>second state</em> of the print, the character of
the nobleman's face is altered; the bow under his chin is broader, and
the shadows on the sole of his right shoe considerably strengthened.
Girl's cloak and woman's apron darker than at first. <em>Third state</em>&mdash;I
discover no alterations, except the shadows being darkened. Engraved
by B. Baron.</p>

<p>Plate 4. One of the newspapers of March 1798, in a critique upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the opera, remarked, that "in playing upon the pianoforte, the celebrated
Dusek displayed <em>a brilliancy of finger</em> which no eulogium could
do justice to!" This is lofty language, and might be very properly
applied to the figure of Carestini in this print, for that mountain of
mummy displays a glittering ring upon every finger of his left hand.
His face, as well as that of the Countess, is in the third impression
essentially altered; the curtains, frames, etc. are also of a much darker
hue. Engraved by S. Ravenet.</p>

<p>Plate 5. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;All the lights, figures on the tapestry,
etc., are kept down, and the whole print brought to a more still and
sombre hue. Woman's eye, eyebrow, and neck strengthened: nostril
made wider. Counsellor's leg and thigh intersected with black lines,
instead of the delicate marks and dots first inserted. <em>Third state</em>&mdash;Bears
evident marks of a coarser burin than that of Ravenet. Engraved
by R. F. Ravenet.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Nichols states that this background was engraved by Ravenet's
wife; but I am informed by Mr. Charles Grignion, who at that period
knew the family intimately, that she could not engrave. That, concerning
the background of this print, Ravenet had a violent quarrel
with Hogarth; who, thinking the figures in the tapestry, etc. too obtrusive,
obliged him to bring them to a lower tone (without any additional
remuneration), a process that must have taken him up a length of time,
which no man but an engraver can form an idea of.</p>

<p>Plate 6. With a slight alteration, the crying old woman would be
very like one of the laughing old women in the Laughing Audience.
<em>Second state</em>&mdash;The whole of the print rendered less brilliant, but more
in harmony. Drapery of the dying woman improved. <em>Third state</em>&mdash;The
shadows of this, as of the other five, were rendered still stronger
by the last alterations, made a short time before Hogarth's death.</p>

<p>Of the original pictures, now in Mr. Angerstein's collection, I have
already spoken. If considered in the various relations of invention,
composition, drawing, colouring, character, and moral tendency, I do
not think it will be easy to point out any series of six pictures, painted
by any artist of either ancient or modern times, from which they will
not bear away the palm.</p>

<p>Among Mr. Lane's papers was found a written description of
Marriage à la Mode, which the family believe to be Hogarth's explanation,
either copied from his own handwriting, or given verbally to Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Lane at the time he purchased the pictures. This was copied and
inserted in the second edition of <cite>Hogarth Illustrated</cite>, and may be had
gratis by any of the purchasers of the first.</p>

<p>Messrs. Boydell have employed Mr. Earlom to engrave the whole
series, in the same size as the original pictures.</p>

<p>2. A small portrait of Archbishop Herring, surrounded with a
trophy, placed as a headpiece to the printed speech addressed to the
Clergy of York, September 24th, 1745. William Hogarth, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pinx.</i>;
C. Mosely, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sculp.</i></p>

<p>3. The same head was afterwards cut off the plate, and printed without
the speech.</p>

<p>A larger portrait was in the year 1750 engraved by Baron.</p>

<p>4. The Battle of the Pictures. Ticket to admit persons to bid for
his works at an auction.</p>

<p>5. Mask and Palette. Subscription-ticket to Garrick in Richard <span class="fs80">III.</span>
A copy from this was published in 1781.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1746.</p>

<p>1. Simon Lord Lovat. <a href="#LOV"><em>Vide</em> p. 209.</a></p>

<p>The second impressions are marked "price 1s."</p>

<p>Of this there have been several copies; I have one of the head in a
watch paper.</p>

<p>Lavater has introduced this print in his <cite>Essays on Physiognomy</cite>.</p>

<p>2. Mr. Garrick in the character of Richard <span class="fs80">III.</span></p>

<p>Engraved by Wm. Hogarth and C. Grignion.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Grignion (whose professional talents have for more than
half a century been an honour to the arts) informed me that Hogarth
etched the head and hand, but finding the head too large, he erased it
and etched it a second time, when seeing it wrong placed upon the
shoulders, he again rubbed it out, and replaced it as it now stands,
remarking&mdash;"I never was right until I had been wrong."</p>

<p>3. Subscription-ticket to the March to Finchley, which was originally
published at 7s. 6d.</p>

<p>Among a stand of various weapons, bagpipes, etc., the artist has
introduced a pair of scissors cutting out the Arms of Scotland.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1747.</p>

<p>1. The Stage Coach, or Country Inn Yard. In the very earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
impressions, a flag behind the wheel of the coach is without an inscription.
In the second, "No Old Baby;" which words, in the present
state of the plate, are done away, and the flag obliterated.</p>

<p>2. Industry and Idleness, in twelve plates, designed and engraved by
Wm. Hogarth.</p>

<p>Plate 1. In the very early impressions, Plate 1 is not inserted.
<em>Second state</em>&mdash;Shadows strengthened.</p>

<p>Plate 2. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;Shadows on the organ, etc. deeper.</p>

<p>Plate 3. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;Lines stronger.</p>

<p>Plate 4. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;Lines strengthened. The cat in this print is
vilely drawn.</p>

<p>Plate 5. Tender lines in the offing worn out, broader lines in the
faces. Lavater has introduced a small outline of this print in his
<cite>Essays on Physiognomy</cite>.</p>

<p>Plate 6. <em>First state</em>&mdash;Goodchild and West, instead of West and
Goodchild, to which the sign was afterwards altered.</p>

<p>Plate 7. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;Darker shadows behind the broken cup, and
bottles on the chimney-piece, etc.</p>

<p>Plate 8. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;Shadows strengthened. The head of the
fat Citizen in a tie-wig has been copied in a larger size by Bartolozzi.
The scene is laid in Fishmonger's Hall, where the effigies of Sir
William Walworth still remain, with the following quaint and memorable
inscription beneath:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Brave Walworth, knight, Lord Maior, that slew</p>
<p class="verse4">Rebellious Tyler in his alarms;</p>
<p class="verse">The king therefore did give in lieu,</p>
<p class="verse4">The dagger to the city arms."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Plate 9. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;Character of the woman taking a bribe
altered; the whole print more black.</p>

<p>Plate 10. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;Shadows heightened.</p>

<p>Plate 11. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;Shadows in the parson's face, pigeon, etc.,
stronger.</p>

<p>Plate 12. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;Coachman's coat darker, and a stripe of lace
down the arm obliterated. The mass of figures that surround the
coach made much darker. In the original they come too forward, but
the characters are now hurt by the intersecting lines.</p>

<p>Of these twelve plates there are tolerably correct copies of the same
size.</p>

<p>The following memoranda relative to this series, which I found among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Hogarth's papers, seems addressed to some one whom he intended to
continue Rouquet's descriptions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The effects of Idleness and Industry, exemplified in the conduct of
two fellow-'prentices. These twelve prints were calculated for the
instruction of young people; and everything addressed to them is fully
described in words as well as figures. Yet to foreigners a translation
of the mottoes,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> the intention of the story, and some little description
of each print, may be necessary. To this may be added, a slight
account of our customs&mdash;as boys being usually bound for seven
years, etc.</p>

<p>"Considering the persons they were intended to serve, I have endeavoured
to render them intelligible, and cheap as possible.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Fine
engraving is not necessary for such subjects, if what is infinitely more
material, viz. character and expression, is properly preserved. Suppose
the whole story were made into a kind of tale, describing in
episode the nature of a night-cellar, a marrow-bone concert, a Lord
Mayor's show, etc.</p>

<p>"These prints I have found sell much more rapidly at Christmas
than at any other season."</p>

<p>3. Jacobus Gibbs Architectus; W. Hogarth, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">delin.</i>; J. M'Ardell,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fecit</i>. Partly mezzotinto, partly graved. No date.</p>

<p>4. Ditto, engraved by Baron.</p>

<p>5. Ditto, by ditto.</p>

<p>6. Another copy, with the addition of "Architectus, A.M. and
F.R.S.," was published 1750. Of the last print I have an impression
where the background is completed, but nothing more of the head
than the bare outline. This is a curiosity somewhat similar to a
picture without a horse by Wouvermans.</p>

<p>Besides these, there is a small profile of Gibbs in a circle, which I
do not think Hogarth's,&mdash;at least it is uncertain.</p>

<p>7. Arms of the Foundling Hospital, printed on the tops of the
indenture.</p>

<p>8. The same in a smaller size, employed as a vignette to <cite>Psalms,
Hymns, and Anthems</cite>, and also to an account of the institution of the
hospital, etc.</p>

<p>Of the original pen-and-ink drawing there is a modern copy.</p>

<p>9. A Wooden Cut&mdash;headpiece to the <cite>Jacobites' Journal</cite>; a newspaper
set up and supported by Henry Fielding. This print (of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>there is a modern copy in aquatinta) was prefixed to six or seven of
the earliest papers, and then set aside. Mine is dated "2d January
1747. No. 5."</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1748.</p>

<p>1. View of Mr. Ranby's House at Chiswick; etched by Hogarth,
without any inscription. Afterwards "published for Jane Hogarth,"
etc., 1st May 1781.</p>

<p>2. Hymen and Cupid; two figures, with the view of a magnificent
villa in the distance. No inscription. This was engraved as a
ticket for the <cite>Masque of Alfred</cite>, performed at Cliveden House before
the Prince and Princess of Wales on the Princess Augusta's birthday.
It was afterwards intended to be used as a receipt to the Sigismunda;
on the earliest impressions, "£2, 2s." is usually <em>written</em>.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1749.</p>

<p>The Gate of Calais; engraved by C. Mosely. The original picture
is in the possession of the Earl of Charlemont.</p>

<p>Of this print Hogarth thus writes:&mdash;"After the March to Finchley,
the next print I engraved was the Roast Beef of Old England,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> which
took its rise from a visit I paid to France the preceding year. The
first time an Englishman goes from Dover to Calais, he must be struck
with the different face of things at so little a distance. A farcical
pomp of war, pompous parade of religion, and much bustle with very
little business. To sum up all, poverty, slavery, and innate insolence,
covered with an affectation of politeness, give you even here a true
picture of the manners of the whole nation. Nor are the priests less
opposite to those of Dover than the two shores. The friars are dirty,
sleek, and solemn; the soldiery are lean, ragged, and tawdry; and as
to the fishwomen, their faces are absolute leather.</p>

<p>"As I was sauntering about and observing them, near the gate
which, it seems, was built by the English when the place was in our
possession, I remarked some appearance of the arms of England on
the front. By this and idle curiosity I was prompted to make a sketch
of it, which being observed, I was taken into custody; but not attempting
to cancel any of my sketches or memorandums, which were
found to be merely those of a painter for his private use, without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
relation to fortification, it was not thought necessary to send me back
to Paris.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> I was only closely confined to my own lodgings till the
wind changed for England, where I no sooner arrived than I set about
the picture; made the gate my background; and in one corner introduced
my own portrait,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> which has generally been thought a correct
likeness, with the soldier's hand upon my shoulder. By the fat friar
who stops the lean cook that is sinking under the weight of a vast
sirloin of beef, and two of the military bearing off a great kettle of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soup maigre</i>, I meant to display to my own countrymen the striking
difference between the food, priests, soldiers, etc. of two nations so
contiguous, that in a clear day one coast may be seen from the other.
The melancholy and miserable Highlander, browsing on his scanty
fare, consisting of a bit of bread and an onion, is intended for one of
the many that fled from this country after the rebellion in 1745."</p>

<p>2. Portrait of John Palmer, Esq.; W. Hogarth, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pinx.</i>; B. Baron,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sculp.</i> A small head inserted under a view of the church of Ecton,
Northamptonshire.</p>

<p>3. Head of Hogarth in a cap, with a pug dog, and a palette with
the line of beauty, etc.; inscribed "Gulielmus Hogarth <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">se ipse pinxit
et sculpsit</i>, 1749."</p>

<p>The same portrait in mezzotinto.</p>

<p>(The engraving was copied from a picture now in the collection of
J. J. Angerstein, Esq., from which another copy, engraved by
Benjamin Smith, was in 1795 published by Messrs. Boydell. In this
the three books are lettered <em>Shakspeare</em>, <em>Swift</em>, <em>Milton's Paradise Lost</em>,
and the line on the palette inscribed, "The Line of Beauty and
Grace.")</p>

<p>In the year 1763 Hogarth erased his own head from the plate, and
in its place inserted "The Bruiser, C. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Churchil (once'">Churchill (once</ins> the Rev<sup>d</sup>.!), in
the character of a Russian Hercules, regaling himself after having
killed the monster Caricatura, that so sorely galled his <em>virtuous</em> friend
the heaven-born Wilkes."</p>

<p><em>First state</em>&mdash;Three of the upper knots on the club are left white
(white lies), and a line inscribed "the line of Beauty," drawn on the
palette. <em>Second state</em>&mdash;The knots shaded, and a political print introduced
on the palette.</p>

<p><em>Third state</em>&mdash;The letters "N. B.," and the word "Infamous"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>inscribed on the club; and "Dragon of Wantley" added at the end
of "I warrant ye." "Price 1s. 6d." instead of "1s."</p>

<p>In the year 1758 Hogarth published a full-length of his own
portrait, painting the Comic Muse; inscribed "W. Hogarth, serjeant
painter to his Majesty,"&mdash;"Engraved by W. Hogarth." This being a
mistake of the writing engraver, the painter altered it to "the face
engraved by W. Hogarth." <em>Third impression</em>&mdash;"The face engraved
by W. Hogarth" omitted. <em>Fourth state</em>&mdash;"Serjeant painter," etc.
scratched over with the graver. <em>Present state</em>&mdash;The face retouched.
Comedy also has the face and mask marked with black; and on the
pillar is written, "Comedy, 1764." No other inscription beneath the
print but "W. Hogarth, 1764."</p>

<p>The original small whole-length picture from which it is copied was
sold by Greenwood after Mrs. Hogarth's death. The companion
portrait of Mrs. Hogarth is in the possession of Mrs. Lewis of
Chiswick.</p>

<p>A portrait of Hogarth was in 1781 engraved in mezzotinto by
Charles Townley from a picture painted by Weltdon, and finished by
Hogarth, now in the possession of James Townley, Esq. A portrait,
copied from that in the Gate of Calais, I have seen prefixed to a dull
pamphlet, published in 1781, entitled <cite>A Dissertation on Mr. Hogarth's
six Prints lately published, viz. Gin Lane, Beer Street, and the
Four Stages of Cruelty</cite>. I have a small engraving of his head, I
believe done for the <cite>Universal Magazine</cite>, in which he looks like a
village schoolmaster. An etching of his head by S. Ireland was prefixed
to a catalogue of Hogarth's works, sold by Christie, in May 1797.
Two small portraits have been engraved for watch-papers. A head in
the dotted style has been engraved for Mr. Jeffrey, Pall Mall, but is
not published.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1750.</p>

<p>The March to Finchley; engraved by Luke Sullivan. Dedicated
to the King of Prusia: thus was the word spelt in the prints delivered
to the subscribers. A few early impressions were dated 30th
December 1750; but the 30th being that year on a Sunday, it was
altered to the 31st. A print in the collection of Dr. Ford is inscribed
"Printed and published by W<sup>m</sup>. Hogarth," instead of " Printed for
W<sup>m</sup>. Hogarth, and published," etc. In the etching, of which very
few were struck off, the woman to whom an officer presents a letter on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
the point of a pike, turns her head the contrary way to what she does
in the print.</p>

<p><em>Second impression</em>&mdash;The spelling of Prussia corrected; bunch of
grapes at the Adam and Eve enlarged; catching lights given to the
laced hats in the group beneath it; belt added to the Duke of Cumberland's
portrait. <em>Third state</em>&mdash;"Retouched and improved by
W<sup>m</sup>. Hogarth; and republished June 12th, 1761."</p>

<p>I have an early impression of this print in which the dedication to
the King of Prussia does not appear, and it might pass for a proof.
On inquiry I find that, upon one of Hogarth's fastidious friends objecting
to its being dedicated to a foreign potentate, he replied, "If you
disapprove of it, <em>you</em> shall have one without any dedication;" and took
off a few impressions, covering the dedication with fan paper.</p>

<p>Sullivan was so eccentric a character, that while he was employed in
engraving this print, Hogarth held out every possible inducement to his
remaining at his house in Leicester Square night and day; for if once
Luke quitted it, he was not visible for a month. It has been said, but
I know not on what authority, that for engraving it he was paid only
one hundred pounds.</p>

<p>In the original picture, which is in the Foundling Hospital, the old
man to whom a Frenchman is giving a letter has a plaid waistcoat.</p>

<p>1. Beer Street. In the <em>first state</em>&mdash;The blacksmith is lifting up a
Frenchman; in the <em>second</em>&mdash;The Frenchman is properly discarded, and
a shoulder of mutton supplies his place.</p>

<p>2. Gin Lane. I have been told that in a print in the collection
of Lord Exeter there are numerous though trifling variations; but I
never saw it.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Of their intentions, Hogarth gives the following account:&mdash;"When
these two prints were designed and engraved, the dreadful consequences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
of gin-drinking appeared in every street. In Gin Lane, every
circumstance of its horrid effects is brought to view <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in terrorem</i>. Idleness,
poverty, misery, and distress, which drives even to madness and
death, are the only objects that are to be seen; and not a house in
tolerable condition but the pawnbroker's and gin-shop.</p>

<p>"Beer Street, its companion, was given as a contrast, where that
invigorating liquor is recommended in order to drive the other out of
vogue. Here all is joyous and thriving: industry and jollity go hand
in hand. In this happy place the pawnbroker's is the only house going
to ruin; and even the small quantity of porter that he can procure is
taken in at the wicket, for fear of further distress."</p>

<p>3. The Four Stages of Cruelty&mdash;</p>

<p>Plate 1. Shadows strengthened.</p>

<p>Plate 2. Shadows heightened.</p>

<p>Plate 3. The whole print somewhat darker.</p>

<p>Plate 4. This, and the five last-mentioned prints, were, on common
paper, marked "price 1s.;" on superior paper, "1s. 6d." The
stamp by which the artist marked the "6d." was cut by himself on a
halfpenny, now in my possession. Of Plates 3 and 4 there are
wooden cuts, which were engraved under Hogarth's inspection.</p>

<p>The motives by which Hogarth was induced to make the designs, he
thus describes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The leading points in these as well as the two preceding prints,
were made as obvious as possible, in the hope that their tendency
might be seen by men of the lowest rank. Neither minute accuracy
of design nor fine engraving were deemed necessary, as the latter would
render them too expensive for the persons to whom they were intended
to be useful; and the fact is, that the passions may be more forcibly
expressed by a strong, bold stroke, than by the most delicate engraving.
To expressing them as I felt them, I have paid the utmost attention;
and as they were addressed to hard hearts, have rather preferred leaving
them hard, and giving the effect, by a quick touch, to rendering them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
languid and feeble by fine strokes and soft engraving, which require
more care and practice than can often be attained, except by a man of
a very quiet turn of mind. Masson, who gave two strokes to every
particular hair that he engraved, merited great admiration; but at such
admiration I never aspired, neither was I capable of obtaining it if
I had.</p>

<p>"The prints were engraved with the hope of, in some degree, correcting
that barbarous treatment of animals, the very sight of which
renders the streets of our metropolis so distressing to every feeling
mind. If they have had this effect, and check the progress of cruelty,
I am more proud of having been the author than I should be of
having painted Raphael's Cartoons.</p>

<p>"The French, among their other mistakes respecting our tragedies,
etc., assert that such scenes could not be represented except by a
barbarous people. Whatever may be our <em>national character</em>, I trust
that our <em>national conduct</em> will be an unanswerable refutation."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>4. Paul before Felix; "designed and scratched in the true Dutch
taste by W<sup>m</sup>. Hogarth." Under the second impression, "designed
and etched in the ridiculous manner of Rembrandt by W<sup>m</sup>. Hogarth."
The drowsy angel was (I have been told) intended as a portrait of Luke
Sullivan. The advocate is said to be designed for Dr. King. See
Worlidge's <cite>View of Lord Westmoreland's Installation</cite>.</p>

<p><em>Second state</em>&mdash;A little devil sawing off the leg of the apostle's stool.</p>

<p>This very whimsical print was originally given as a receipt to the
Pharaoh's Daughter and the serious Paul before Felix, and sealed with
a palette and pencils, engraven on a small ring which Hogarth usually
wore, and which Mrs. Lewis has since presented to me. The early
proofs are usually stained with bister. Hogarth always gave the print
to such of his friends as wished for it; but finding demands too frequent,
cut the engraved receipt from the copper, and sold it at 5s.
From this print in its first state he took a few reverses.</p>

<p>2. The same subject, with fewer figures, and those reversed on the
plate. This, though not good, is, in arrangement, design, and engraving,
much superior to the preceding. The same text and inscription,
"from his original painting," etc., is continued, though that first
mentioned is the copy from the picture in Lincoln's-Inn Hall.</p>

<p>"Published Feb. 5, 1752. Engraved by Luke Sullivan."</p>

<p>In the <em>second state</em>&mdash;A quotation from Dr. Warton's <cite>Essay on the
Genius and Writings of Pope</cite> was inserted in one corner of the margin;
but the critique which it contained being founded in a mistake, which
the Doctor in the second edition very liberally retracted, Hogarth, in
some of the succeeding impressions, covered the quotation with paper
when the print was taken off, and afterwards entirely effaced it from
the copper.</p>

<p>In the present state of the plate, the date of publication and name
of the engraver are taken out.</p>

<p>Hogarth's subscription-book, with the names of all, and autographs
of most of the subscribers, is in my possession; and by this it appears
that the subscription to the first print of an Election Entertainment, or
to the complete set, commenced 28th March 1754. From this time to
the 31st of May in the same year, there were 461 subscribers to the
first print, and 127 to the complete set. The leading names on the list
are the Prince of Wales, the Princess-Dowager of Wales, and Prince
Edward; but the first person that has any money annexed to his
signature is the Right Hon. Henry Fox, afterwards Lord Holland.</p>

<p>The subscription for the remaining three prints was opened 24th
Feb. 1755, and closed 28th August 1756. To this there were only
165 subscribers, so that there were 296 names to the first print who did
not continue to subscribe to the other three.</p>

<p>As a receipt to these prints, he gave the following engraving, with
emblematical devices of Crowns, Mitres, etc., published in the year
1736, as a headpiece to an inscription expressing his gratitude to the
Legislature for passing the Act to protect prints from piracy, etc.:&mdash;</p>

prints representing the polling," etc.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120"><span class="smcap">Four Prints of an Election.</span></p>

<p>Plate 1. An Election Entertainment.</p>

<p>It has been said that Hogarth attempted to finish this plate without
taking a single proof from it, to examine the effect as he proceeded in
his work. Be that as it may, the <em>little</em> alterations are more numerous
than in any of his other prints; and that in the inscription, stating the
<em>whole</em> to be engraved by Hogarth, being so often inserted and repeatedly
effaced, I am unable to account for.</p>

<p><em>First state</em>&mdash;"Painted, and the whole engraved by W<sup>m</sup>. Hogarth,"
"Published 24th Feb. 1755," and "Inscribed to the Right Honourable
Henry Fox, etc. etc. etc."</p>

<p>Seven cut lemons on a piece of paper close to the punch-tub; four
hats in the corner; "For our Country," on the riband in the striped
cap of the butcher pouring out gin. A salt-cellar and a bit of bread
near the fork upon the table.</p>

<p><em>Second state</em>&mdash;The two words, "the whole," in the inscription,
scratched over with black lines; the drapery, stockings, etc. on the
table before Richard Slim made much darker; the hand of the fat old
woman, close to the candidate, removed from under her apron, and
hanging down by her side, by which the shoulder, elbow, etc. are thrown
out of drawing; her countenance less clear, and a single tooth, very
conspicuous in the first impression, is here removed. Shadow on the
top of the wainscot in the left corner effaced. Half a casement near
the painting of a landscape changed to a window-shutter; the king's
head, frame, and background behind it, lighter; the salt-cellar and bit
of bread removed from the table; lemons taken out, and the tub, pail,
and foreground below them much lighter; the boy's napkin darker.
The butcher's cap, in which was "For our Country," has now "<span class="fs80">PRO
PATRIA</span>," and is not striped; the open-back chair in which he was seated
in the <em>first state</em>, is here filled up to a cushion back. The words,
"sure votes" and "doubtful," in the attorney's book, are re-engraved.
Both leaves are shadowed, and the centre line from top to bottom,
which in the <em>first state</em> was with the "sure votes," is here transferred
to the "doubtful." Two pearly drops are trickling from the parson's
forehead. Four windows are added to a house seen out of the open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
casement; a pair of scissors suspended to the Methodist tailor's apron-string,
and the pen, stuck under the wig of the fellow who offers him a
bribe, which in the <em>first state</em> was with the feather outwards, is now
properly altered to the quill outwards. There are several other little
variations in the shadows which seem generally intended to bring the
print into harmony; and I think have their effect, for it is more still,
and in better keeping than in the <em>first state</em>.</p>

<p><em>Third state</em>&mdash;The cross strokes of the graver on the words "the
whole," in the inscription, nearly burnished out. One hat added in
the corner, and another placed on the bench near the scabbard and
gloves. The face, knot, etc. of the little girl near the candidate
darkened; and the hair of the fellow smoking him much shadowed,
and rendered less woolly. Character of face of the boy pouring punch
altered, and hair made much darker.</p>

<p><em>Fourth state</em>&mdash;The words "the whole" again inserted; the W is
different, and engraving not so good as in the <em>first state</em>: the shadow
on the top of the wainscot, close to the landscape, again restored. A
strong shadow on the lower part of the round table in the corner
burnished down.</p>

<p><em>Fifth</em>, which is the <em>present state</em>&mdash;The words "the whole" again
completely effaced by black lines. The masses somewhat stronger, and
the shadows on the round table in the corner, especially on the edge,
made darker.</p>

<p>I have this print in all the states here described, and believe that the
third and fourth are very uncommon.</p>

<p>On the butcher with "<span class="fs80">PRO PATRIA</span>" in his cap, and his wounded
companion, Hogarth makes the following remark:&mdash;</p>

<p>"These two patriots, who, let what party will prevail, can be no
gainers, yet spend their time, which is <em>their</em> fortune, for what they suppose
right, and for a glass of gin lose their blood, and sometimes their
lives, in support of <em>the cause</em>, are, as far as I can see, entitled to an
equal portion of fame with many of the emblazoned heroes of ancient
Rome; but such is the effect of prejudice, that though the picture of an
antique wrestler is admired as a grand character, we necessarily annex
an idea of vulgarity to the portrait of a modern boxer. An old blacksmith
in his tattered garb is a coarse and low being; strip him naked,
tie his leathern apron round his loins, chisel out his figure in freestone
or marble, precisely as it appears&mdash;he becomes elevated, and may pass
for a philosopher, or a Deity."</p>

<p>Plate 2. Canvassing for Votes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>"Engraved by C. Grignion, published 20th February 1757," and
inscribed to Sir Charles Hanbury Williams.</p>

<p>In this admirable print I discover no variations, except that the lion's
teeth are, in the <em>second impression</em>, removed; and the lines throughout
having been re-entered, are somewhat darker than in the <em>first state</em>.</p>

<p>Plate 3. The Polling.</p>

<p>"Engraved by Hogarth and Le Cave, published 20th February
1758," and inscribed to the Hon. Sir Ed. Walpole.</p>

<p>In an etching (touched in the shadows by Hogarth) which I have of
this plate, the blind voter going up the steps has not any bandage over
his eyes. The cockade of the sick figure just before him is not of
sufficient length for the words "true blue" now inserted, and probably
an afterthought. The fellow before him with a pipe in his mouth, in
the print is without a nose, but in the etching has a very large one;
while the man to whom this old smoker is presenting tobacco, and who
in the print has so speculative and carbuncled a proboscis, has, in the
etching, scarcely any nose at all. The book in the pocket of Dr.
Shebeare is so much intersected as not to admit of the inscription, afterwards
added, of ("the 6th letter to the"), without the strokes being
burnished out.</p>

<p><em>Second impression</em>&mdash;"Milicia Bill," awkwardly inscribed on the
maimed voter's skirt, intended to appear as a paper hanging out of his
pocket.</p>

<p>Plate 4. Chairing the Members.</p>

<p>"Engraved by W. Hogarth and F. Aviline; published 1st January
1758," and inscribed to the Hon. George Hay, one of the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty.</p>

<p><em>Second impression</em>&mdash;The word <span class="fs80">INDINTUR</span> (indenture) written on the
scroll hanging out of the attorney's window.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1756.</p>

<p>1. France and England, in two plates, "designed and etched by
Hogarth," and published March 8, 1756.</p>

<p>In the very early impressions of these prints, the titles France and
England are not inserted.</p>


<p class="p1 pfs120">1758.</p>

<p>The Bench, "designed and engraved by W. Hogarth," and published
4th September 1758.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>This plate, in its <em>first state</em>, exhibits the inside of the Court of Common
Pleas, the king's arms at top. Portraits of the following judges
are beneath it:&mdash;Hon. William Noel; Sir John Willes, Lord Chief
Justice; Hon. Mr. Justice, afterwards Earl Bathurst; Sir Edward
Clive.</p>

<p>Over the print is written "Character;" under it, "Of the different
meanings of the words Character, Caricatura, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Outré</i>, in painting
and drawing." This is followed by a long explanatory inscription
engraved on another piece of copper. The original picture, which is
somewhat different from the print, was once the property of Sir George
Hay, and is now in the possession of Mr. Edwards.</p>

<p><em>Present state</em> of the plate&mdash;The word Character is effaced, and the
king's arms discarded, and its place supplied by eight caricatured
heads, on which the artist worked the day before he died. Below the
inscription is inserted&mdash;</p>

<p>"The unfinished group of heads in the upper part of this print
was added by the author in October 1764, and was intended as a further
illustration of what is here said concerning character, caricatura, and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</i>. He worked upon it the day before his death, which happened
the 26th of that month."</p>

<p>The mistakes which Hogarth's friends frequently made in the meaning
of the words character, caricatura, etc., seem to have dwelt much
on his mind. In one of his <span class="fs80">MSS.</span> he has given the following thoughts
on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have ever considered the knowledge of character, either high or
low, to be the most sublime part of the art of painting or sculpture,
and caricatura as the lowest&mdash;indeed, as much so as the wild attempts
of children when they first try to draw: yet so it is, that the two
words, from being similar in sound, are often confounded. When I
was once at the house of a foreign face-painter, and looking over a
legion of his portraits, Monsieur, with a low bow, told me that he infinitely
admired my caricatures! I returned his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">congé</i>, and assured
him that I equally admired his.</p>

<p>"I have often thought that much of this confusion might be done
away, by recurring to the three branches of the drama, and considering
the difference between comedy, tragedy, and farce. Dramatic dialogue,
which represents nature as it really is, though neither in the most
elevated nor yet the most familiar style, may fairly be denominated
comedy: for every incident introduced might have thus happened;
every syllable have been thus spoken, and so acted in common life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Tragedy is made up of more extraordinary events. The language is in
a degree inflated, and the action and emphasis heightened. The performer
swells his voice, and assumes a consequence in his gait; even
his habit is full and ample, to keep it on a par with his deportment.
Every feature of his character is so much above common nature, that
were people off the stage to act, speak, and dress in a similar style,
they would be thought fit for Bedlam. Yet with all this, if the player
does not o'erstep the proper bounds, and, by attempting too much,
become swoln, it is not caricatura, but elevated character. I will go
further, and admit, that with the drama of Shakspeare, and action of
Garrick, it may be a nobler species of entertainment than comedy.</p>

<p>"As to farce, where it is exaggerated, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</i>, I have no objection
to its being called caricature, for such is the proper title."</p>

I have seen an impression of this print without the name "Crates" in

coronation, measured architectonically."</p>

<p><em>Second impression</em>&mdash;The spelling in the word "advertisement"
corrected, by an <em>e</em> inserted on the neck of the Duchess of Northumberland.
This is a pointed ridicule on Stewart's <cite>Antiquities of Athens</cite>, in
which the measurements of all the members of the Greek architecture
are given with minute accuracy. Hogarth's opinion of his labours may
be gathered from the following fragment, which he wrote concerning
this print:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is no great difficulty in measuring the length, breadth, or
height of any figures, where the parts are made up of plain lines. It
requires no more skill to take the dimensions of a pillar or cornice,
than to measure a square box; and yet the man who does the latter is
neglected, and he who accomplishes the former is considered as a
miracle of genius; but I suppose he receives his honours for the distance
he has travelled to do his business."</p>

<p>7. Frontispiece to the <cite>Farmer's Return from London</cite>; engraved by
J. Basire. Of this plate there is an admirable copy with the same

<p>5. The Shrimp Girl. Engraved in the dotted style by Bartolozzi.
Had this unrivalled artist etched this print in the manner he did
Guercino's drawings, he would have transferred the true spirit of the
original. As it is, we have Hogarth translated into Italian.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs120"><span class="smcap">Prints of Uncertain Date.</span></p>

<p>Some of the following prints are insignificant enough, others are
curious, but all derive their principal value from being the work of
Hogarth. I have noted the prices at which a few of them sold, and
think it probable that No. 30 produced more money at Mr. Gulston's
sale than the artist received for engraving the twenty-nine preceding
prints:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>12. A Coat of Arms, engraved on a silver tea-table.</p>

<p>I had nearly forgotten two curiosities, which, though received in all
the catalogues, and unquestionably genuine, can hardly be classed as
prints. One is entitled Hogarth's Cottage, engraved for Mr. Camfield,
a surgeon, on a breeches button the size of a half-crown, from Hogarth's
design, of which an etched copy by S. Ireland was published March 1,
1786. The other, being impressions taken from nine quadrille fish, was
published in 1792, with the title of&mdash;</p>

<p>Pisces, one of the signs of the Zodiac.</p>

<p>To enter into the spirit of the last article, the reader must be informed
that Hogarth never played at cards; and that while his wife and a
party of friends were so employed, he occasionally took the quadrille
fish, and cut upon them scales, fins, heads, etc., so as to give them
some degree of character. Three of these little aquatic curiosities which
remained in the possession of Mrs. Lewis, she presented to me, and I

manners, and stamps a diversity, life, quickness, sensibility, and expressive
significance over everything they do. In another place it is
more negative and contracted: being formed in direct opposition to the
first, its measures were regulated accordingly; much pains were taken
to root out and to remove everything that might give wing to imagination,
and so to regulate the outward man by a torpid inanimate composure,
gravity, and indifference, that it may attend to nothing but
mere acts of necessity, everything else being reputed idle and vain.

Abbé le Blanc, in his letter to the Abbé du Bos on the state of painting
and sculpture in England, notices the whole body in the following <em>very
flattering</em> terms: "The portrait painters are at this day more numerous
and worse in London than ever they have been. Since Mr. Vanloo
came hither, they strive in vain to run him down; for nobody is
painted but by him. I have been to see the most noted of them; at
some distance one might easily mistake a dozen of their portraits for
twelve copies of the same original. Some have the head turned to the
left, others to the right; and this is the most sensible difference to be
observed between them. Moreover, excepting the face, you find in all
the same neck, the same arms, the same flesh, the same attitude; and
to say all, you observe no more life than design in those pretended
portraits. Properly speaking, they are not painters; they know how
to lay colours on the canvas, but they know not how to animate it.
Nature exists in vain for them; they see her not, or if they see her,
they have not the art of expressing her."</p></div>

To say that it is superior to these is but slight praise; independent
of this relative superiority, it will not be easy to point out a better
painted portrait. The head, which is marked with uncommon benevolence,
was in 1739 engraved in mezzotinto by M'Ardell.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> Thus does Hogarth pun upon the name of Mr. Ramsay, who he

paid for the player rather than the picture. It was painted for the late

Royal Academy of Arts of London</cite>, places the causes of this disagreement
in a point of view somewhat different from Mr. Hogarth's narrative;
but in their account of the consequences the narrators precisely
agree:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"A society, composed of a number of the most respectable persons
in this country, commonly known by the name of the 'Dilettanti,'
made the first step towards an establishment of this nature. That
society having accumulated a considerable fund, and being really promoters
of the fine arts, generously offered to appropriate it to support
a public academy.
</p>
<p>
"General Gray, a gentleman distinguished by his public spirit and
fine taste, was deputed by that society to treat with the artists. I was
present at their meeting. On the part of our intended benefactors, I
observed that generosity and benevolence which are peculiar to true
greatness; but on the part of the majority of the leading artists, I was
sorry to remark motives, apparently limited to their own views and
ambition to govern, diametrically opposite to the liberality with which
we were treated. After various conferences, the 'Dilettanti' finding
that they were to be allowed no share in the government of the
academy, or in the appropriating their own fund, the negotiation
ended."&mdash;Strange's <cite>Inquiry</cite>, p. 62.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_42_42" id="Footnote_42_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> This society was first projected by Mr. William Shipley, who was
very active in his endeavours to establish it. Their original proposal
was, to "give premiums for the revival and advancement of those arts
and sciences which are at a low ebb amongst us; as poetry, painting,
tapestry, architecture, etc." The plan, in the latter end of the year
1753, was laid before Dr. Hales and Mr. Baker, by whom it was
introduced to Lord Romney and Lord Folkestone, who warmly
patronized the institution.
</p>
<p>
In March 1754, they met at Rathmell's Coffeehouse, Henrietta
Street, Covent Garden. Their first premium for the best drawing by
boys and girls under fourteen years of age was £15; but as the subscribers
were then too few in number to raise the proposed sum, the
two above-named noblemen made good a considerable deficiency.
They next met at the Circulating Library, in Crane Court, Fleet Street,
and on the 10th of January 1755 at Peele's Coffeehouse, where the
first premium of £5 for the best drawing by boys under the age of
fourteen was adjudged to Mr. Richard Cosway.</p></div>

by a great commercial enterprise, should awaken the spirit of the
nation to historical and poetical paintings from the drama of Shakspeare.
This drama has been a school for the representation of all the
passions, and opened to the artist a new mine of rich materials for
displaying the mirror of life in the colours of nature. The Shakspeare
Gallery has been followed by undertakings of a similar description,
and, all united, have afforded a patronage to the arts which had been
vainly sought for among the nobility, and given to such painters as had
the power, a fair opportunity of confuting the visionary assertion, that
it was not possible for an Englishman to paint a good historical picture.</p></div>

It has frequently been the fate of painters, as well as poets, to have
their works disregarded until the authors were out of the hearing of
praise or censure. Young, in his <cite>Love of Fame</cite>, speaking of the value

Mr. Angerstein.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_52_52" id="Footnote_52_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> Sir Joshua Reynolds, whose lectures are, generally speaking, the
best rules conveyed in the best language, in his discourse, read December
11th, 1769, acknowledges "that old pictures celebrated for their
colouring are often so changed by dirt and varnish, that we ought not
to wonder if they do not appear equal to their reputation in the eyes
of unexperienced painters or young students." But he asserts "that
an artist whose judgment is matured by long observation considers
rather what the picture once was than what it is at present. He has
acquired a power by habit of seeing the brilliancy of tints through the
cloud by which it is obscured."
</p>
<p>
Don Quixote, through the cloud of dirt and deformity which obscured
a vulgar country wench, discovered the brilliant beauties of
that peerless princess, the Lady Dulcinea del Toboso! Such is the
power of enchantment.</p></div>

system.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> In this notice of the writers by whom he was attacked, he particularly
alludes to the <cite>North Briton</cite>, No. 17. As to the crooked
compliments paid him by his brethren in art, they were numerous
indeed.
</p>
<p>
Among his papers I found a tolerably spirited drawing in pen and
ink, entitled "A Christmas Gambol from Leicester Square to Westminster
Hall," representing the artist with ass's ears, stripped, and
tied to a cart's tail, and an old fellow with a long wig and cat-o'-nine-tails
in his hand, lashing his naked back, and exclaiming, "You'll
write books, will ye!" A barber's block, fixed on a straight pole, is
stuck at the head of the cart, and labelled, "Perpendicular and beautiful
blockhead." The horse is led by a vulgar drayman, whose locks
being so dishevelled as to form a kind of glory, are inscribed, "Lines
of beauty." Over the head of the painter is this motto: "'Twere
better a millstone had been tied about thy neck, and (<span class="fs80">THOU</span>) cast into
the sea."
</p>
<p>
The following specimen of polite satire and curious orthography
crowns the whole:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"<em>N.B.</em>&mdash;Speedily will be published, an apology, in quarto, called
<cite>Beauty's Defiance to Charicature</cite>; with a very extraordinary frontispiece,
a just portraiture (printed on fool's-cap paper), and descriptive
of the punishment that ought to be inflicted on him that dare give
false and unnatural descriptions of beauty, or charicature great personages;
it being an illegal as well as a mean practice; at the same time
flying in the face of all regular bred gentlemen painters, sculptures,
architects&mdash;in fine&mdash;arts and sciences."
</p>
<p>
Numerous prints were published in ridicule of his system and
himself.
</p>
<p>
In a set of engravings, entitled "The New Dunciad, done with a
view of fixing the fluctuating ideas of taste, dedicated to his friend
Beauty's Analyzer," I find several prints with mottoes, which, in most
vile and vulgar phrase, ridiculed both author and book. Some of them
are not destitute of humour; but all would ere now have been consigned
to oblivion, had not they been occasionally collected as relatives
to Hogarth. One of them is entitled "Pugg's Graces, etched from
his <span class="fs80">ORIGINAL</span> daubing."
</p>
<p>
In this the artist is represented at his easel, with <cite>Lomazzo</cite> in his
pocket, and with a satyr's feet (one of which rests on some copies of
his <cite>Analysis</cite>), and painting the picture of "Pharaoh's Daughter." He
is accompanied by a fat and a lean connoisseur; the former shows
evident marks of admiration, but the latter holds the <cite>Analysis</cite> in his
left hand, and appears rather puzzled. A figure in the background,
who, to show that he is a judge, is arrayed in a gown, a band, and
ample periwig, shows evident marks of disgust. Three naked and
most filthy female figures, one of them fat as was Bright of Malden,
and another tall and thin as a splinter of the Monument, are intended
to represent "Pugg's graceless Graces." One of these <em>beauties</em> rests
her foot on a box inscribed, "For the March presented to the
Foundling Hospital, with a gilded frame for the admiration of the
public." The other is seated on a chest of drawers, on which are
written under the word <span class="fs80">FOLLY</span>, "Bid for by Pugg's friends, £50,
£100, £120." This most pointed piece of wit evidently alludes to
the auction of "Marriage à la Mode," which has been already noticed.
On the upper part of the print is a head, entitled "A modern cherubin,"
with a bag-wig on, and a stick bent into a waving line in his mouth,
a satyr holding a medallion, on which is a head with a cap and bells,
and many other curious allusions to the serpentine line. On the floor
are a pair of stays, a pair of boots, a pair of candlesticks, etc. etc.,
allusive to the prints to the <cite>Analysis</cite>. Beneath is a grotesque figure of
a devil, with a little incubus, masks, etc., holding in his hand a piece
of paper, which seems a leaf of the book, and is inscribed, "To be
continued."

In a well-etched print which, on a monumental stone placed in the
corner, the engraver has chosen to denominate "A self-conceited
arrogant dauber, grovelling in vain to undermine the ever-sacred temple
of the best painters, sculptors, architects, etc., in imitation of the
impious Herostratus, who with sacrilegious flame destroyed the temple
of Diana to perpetuate his name to posterity."
</p>
<p>
We have here a very rich and well-imagined column, the base ornamented
with historical bas-relief; and between a serpent, which is
spirally twisted round a circular pillar, are portraits of painters, sculptors,
etc. At the bottom of this, on his knees, and still with satyr's
legs and feet, and a pen stuck in his hat, the artist has represented
Hogarth; who, attended by a well-dressed connoisseur in the character
of his torch-bearer, accompanied by his favourite dog, and armed with
his palette knife, is grubbing up whatever he can find under it. No. 3,
the inscription informs us, is "A satyr ready to lash the scribbler
away;" and by the same authority we learn that No. 4 are "Geese,"
which being placed close to this emulator of the fame of Erostratus,
"greedily swallows whatever he can rake up with his palette knife," etc.
etc. etc. The print is enriched with cypress trees, capitals, well-formed
vases, and superb edifices; the whole (for it is a night scene) is lighted
up by the temple of Diana in flames. Beneath it is the waving line in
a small triangle, and the following verses:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"The vile Ephesian, to obtain</p>
<p class="verse4">A name&mdash;a temple fires;</p>

<p class="verse4">He had not his desires.</p>
<p class="verse">You might with reason, sure, expect</p>
<p class="verse4">Your fate would be the same;</p>
<p class="verse">Men first thy labours will neglect,</p>
<p class="verse4">Next quite forget thy name."</p>
</div></div>

<p>
One nauseous delineation is entitled, "The Artist in his own Taste;"
and another, "The Author run mad." In one he is represented as
"A mountebank, demonstrating to his admiring audience that crookedness
is most beautiful;" and in another of a larger size, entitled "The
Burlesquer Burlesqued," depicted with satyr's legs, painting what the
designer calls "A history piece, suitable to the painter's capacity, from
a Dutch manuscript." This history piece is a copy of the Dutch
delineation of Abraham sacrificing Isaac, by pointing a blunderbuss at
his head, with an angel hovering over the figures, etc. The lives of
Rembrandt, Rubens, Vandyke, and other eminent painters, are ingeniously
imagined to be torn in pieces to make a window-blind for the
author of the <cite>Analysis of Beauty</cite>; which book, with allusions to it, are
displayed in different parts of the print, and in a storied border at the
bottom it appears to be selling for waste paper.

Of this engraving, the satire of which is principally levelled at the
burlesque "Paul before Felix," there are two editions; the first, for
the more extensive circulation of Hogarth's fame, and the benefit of

French.</p></div>

In what light can we consider the character painted by the bard

</p>
<p>
"That perspective is an essential requisite to a good painter, is
attested by all our most eminent artists, and confirmed by almost every
author who has wrote upon painting. Nay, the very term 'painting'
implies perspective; for to draw a good picture is to draw the representation
of nature as it appears to the eye; and to draw the perspective
representation of any object, is to draw the representation of that
object as it appears to the eye. Therefore the terms 'painting' and
'perspective' seem to be synonymous, though I know there is a critical
difference between the words. I would not be understood to mean
that a person is always to follow the rigid rules of perspective, for
there are some cases in which it may be necessary to deviate from them;
but then he must do it with modesty, and for some good reason, as we
have shown in the course of this work. Nor would I be thought to
desire the artist to make use of scale or compasses upon all occasions,
and to draw out every line and point to a mathematical exactness, as
the design of this work is quite the reverse: it is to teach the general
rules of perspective, and to enforce the practice of it by easy and
almost self-evident principles; to assist the judgment and to direct the
hand, and not to perplex either by unnecessary lines or dry theorems."
</p>
<p>
The publication of this drew forth Mr. Highmore, who, in the preface
of a pamphlet with the following title, now become very scarce,
gave his decided opposition to the system:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"A Critical Examination of those two Paintings on the ceiling of
Whitehall, in which Architecture is introduced, so far as relates to the
Perspective, together with the discussion of a question which has been
the subject of debate among painters. Written many years since, but
now first published, by J. Highmore. Printed for Nourse, 1754."
</p>
<p>
The question Mr. Highmore professes to discuss is by himself stated
as follows, viz.:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Whether a range of columns, standing on a line parallel to the
picture, ought to be painted according to the strict rules of perspective;
that is, whether those columns, in proportion as they recede
from the centre of the picture, should be drawn broader than that
directly opposite to the eye, as the rules require; or whether (because
they really in nature appear less, in proportion as they are more
distant) they ought not to be made less, or at most, equal to each
other in the picture?...
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Kirby says, p. 70 of his first part: 'Since the fallacies of vision
are so many and great, etc., it seems reasonable not to comply with
the strict rules of mathematical perspective, in some particular cases
(as in this before us), but to draw the representations of objects as
they appear to the eye,' etc. But I would ask, How? By guess, or
by some rule? And if by any, by what rule are they to be drawn
contrary to, or different from, the strict mathematical perspective
rules?"
</p>
<p>
In reply to these and many other strictures contained in the preface,
Hogarth wrote some remarks to Mr. Kirby, in which he asks,
"Whether an oval or egg can be the true representation of a sphere
or ball? or whether buildings should be drawn by any such rule as
would make them appear tumbling down, and be allowed to be truly
represented, because the designer of them is able to show how a
spectator may, in half an hour's time, be placed at such a point as
would make them all appear upright? as by a like trick or contrivance
the oval may be foreshortened so as to appear a circle."
</p>
<p>
He further asks, "Would a carpenter allow fourteen inches to be
the true representation of a foot-rule, since in no situation whatever
can the eye possibly see it so?"
</p>
<p>
Again: "Did ever any history-painter widen or distort his figures
as they are removed from the centre of his picture? Or would he
draw a file of musqueteers in that manner, when the last man in the
rank would be broader than high? Why would he then serve a poor
column or pedestal thus, when, poor dumb things, they cannot help
themselves? And are all objects exempt from the rules of perspective
except buildings? Did Highmore ever so much as dream of an intervening
plane when he had been drawing a family piece with four or
five people in a row, so as to distort the bodies and forms of those who
had the misfortune to be placed nearest to the side of the frame?
And what satisfaction would it be to his customers to tell them they
were only disposed by the true rules of perspective, and might be
seen in their proper shape again if they would give themselves the
trouble of looking through a pin hole at a certain distance, which, by
learning perspective, they might be able to find in half an hour's time;
or, to save themselves that trouble, they might get a painter to lug
them about till their eye was brought to the proper point. He then
observes, that he would not have the intervening plane wholly rejected,
but that it should be laid aside when it begins to do mischief, or is of
no use; for it is no doubt as necessary to painters of architecture as
scaffolding is to builders; but, like the latter, is always to be taken
away when the work comes to be finished; and every defect that
either may have occasioned must be corrected by the eye, which is
capable to judge of the most complicated objects, perspectively true,
where the dry mathematics of the art are left far behind as incapable
of lending the least assistance.
</p>
<p>
"These things our mathematicians are strangers to,&mdash;therefore, in
my opinion, have rated them too high. Dr. Swift thought mere
Philos a ridiculous sort of people, as appears by a song of his on two
very remarkable ones&mdash;Whiston and Ditton. I forget it particularly,
but it was about the longitude being mist on by Whiston, and not
better hit on by Ditton: sing Whiston, etc. etc. Ditton has wrote a
good book on speculative perspective."
</p>
<p>
Hogarth then alludes to Highmore's critique on Rubens' ceiling at
Whitehall, and asks, "What is it but what almost every child knows,
even without the knowledge of perspective? viz. that parallel lines
always meet in a point, and that he has with penetration discovered.
Oh, wonderful discovery! that Rubens, unskilfully, has kept them
parallel in his column, to embellish which he has tacked two fibs: one,
that the error was owing to the drawing them as they would appear to
the eye; the other, that the historical figures are truly in perspective;
whereas King James, the principal, has a head widened or distorted,
though it goes off from the eye almost as much as he would have the
side columns, which are the subjects of controversy."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_66_66" id="Footnote_66_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66_66"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> Though Mr. Malton's description is built on fancy as much as Mr.
Hogarth's design, it must be acknowledged that some of his criticism is
just. With respect to the column, nothing either elevated or grand has
yet been produced by violently deviating from the first models. Mr.
Emlyn, in the year 1782, published a proposition for a sixth order,
which in some points resembles Hogarth's. The plan of <em>his</em> column
is to represent the particular character of our English chivalry in its
most illustrious order&mdash;the order of the Garter: it is to be composed of
the single trunks of trees; his capitals are to be copied from the plumage
of the knights' caps, with the Ionic volutes interwoven and bound
together in the front, with the star of the order between them. The
fluting of the trunk is cabled, and the cables hollow and filled with the
English arrow, the feathered end rising out of each of them. The
ornament of the frieze over the columns is a plume of three ostrich
feathers, etc. etc. etc.
</p>
<p>
Sir Joshua Reynolds, in his discourse delivered December 10, 1776,
gives the following strong reasons against any new order succeeding:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Though it is from the prejudice we have in favour of the ancients,
who have taught us architecture, that we had adopted likewise their
ornaments; and though we are satisfied that neither nature nor reason
are the foundation of those beauties which we imagine we see in that
art; yet if any one, persuaded of this truth, should therefore invent
new orders of equal beauty, which we will suppose to be possible, yet
they would not please; nor ought he to complain, since the old has that
great advantage of having custom and prejudice on its side. In this
case we leave what has every prejudice in its favour, to take that which
will have no advantage over what we have left, but novelty, which
soon destroys itself, and at any rate is but a weak antagonist against
custom."</p></div>

1755, after enumerating chasing, engraving, painting, sculpture, architecture,
etc., as arts that are practised in England, concludes with a
chapter on the Art of Cookery, which he thus gravely introduces:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"There is an art, the only one that can justly pretend to unite
pleasure with absolute utility; but this art, born in servitude, to which
it is still condemned, notwithstanding its extreme importance, is
reckoned ignoble, for which reason some perhaps will be surprised
at seeing me give it a place in this work; I mean the art of preparing
aliments."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_69_69" id="Footnote_69_69"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69_69"><span class="label">[69]</span></a> This is a palpable hit at Handel. In a caricatured portrait, entitled
"The Charming Brute," this great composer is delineated sitting on a
hogshead with the profile of a boar, a bill of fare, and other emblems
of voluptuousness scattered round him. Published March 21, 1754.
Motto on a scroll, "I am myself alone," and under the print these
lines:&mdash;

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"The figure's odd, yet who would think,</p>
<p class="verse">Within this tomb of meat and drink</p>

<p class="verse">There can! yon hogshead is his seat,</p>

</div></div>

<p>
When Handel had once a large party to dinner, the cloth being removed,
he introduced plain port. Having drank four or five glasses
with his guests, he suddenly started up&mdash;exclaimed&mdash;"I have a
thought!" and stalked out of the room, to which after a short
absence he returned. Having drank a few more glasses he uttered
the same sentence&mdash;again retreated, and again returned. It was naturally
supposed that he wished to commit to paper some idea that struck
him at the moment, and passed over; but, when in less than an hour
he a third time started&mdash;growled out&mdash;"I have a thought!" and a
third time left the company, one of the gentlemen privately followed,
and traced him into another apartment, where, on looking through the
keyhole, he saw this great master of music kneel down to a hamper of
champagne, that he might more conveniently reach out a flask, which
having nearly finished, he returned to his friends!</p></div>

adepts in the art, about two years since, published a half-guinea book,
on the scientific acquisitions necessary to make a perfect tailor!

<p>
"This day is published, price 10s. 6d., <cite>The Tailor's Complete Guide,

rules for cutting out garments of every kind, and fitting any person
with the greatest accuracy and precision. Also plain directions
how to avoid the errors of the trade in misfitting, and pointing out the
method of rectifying what may be done amiss; to which is added a
description to cut out and make the patent plastic habits and clothes
without the usual seams, now in the highest estimation with the nobility
and gentry, according to the patent granted by his Majesty; the whole
concerted and devised by a society of adepts in the profession.

⁂ "This work was undertaken solely for the benefit of the trade,
to instruct the rising generation, and perfectly to complete them in the

each separated part, which will on the first view convince the uninformed

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_72_72" id="Footnote_72_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_72"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> Hogarth might conceive that, by rendering the habits of his early
figures more conformable to the fashion of the times, when they were
altered he improved them. Collectors are of a different opinion,
though it must be acknowledged that, in Plate <span class="fs80">IV.</span> of "The Rake's
Progress," the humour is much heightened by introducing a group of
vulgar minor gamblers in the place of the shoeblack.</p></div>

with the title of "Piquet, or Virtue in Danger," and is still in the

It may fairly be considered as a moral lesson against gaming. The
clock denotes five in the morning. The lady has lost her money,
jewels, a miniature of her husband, and the half of a £500 bank note,
which, by a letter lying on the floor, she appears to have recently
received from him. In fine, all is lost except her honour; and in this
dangerous moment she is represented perplexed, agitated, and irresolute.
A print of it has lately been finely engraved by Mr. Cheesman.</p></div>

I some years since saw a picture of "Lucretia," by Domenichino, in
the collection of Mr. Welbore Ellis Agar, which in air, attitude, and
expression, bore a strong resemblance to Hogarth's "Sigismunda."</p></div>

During this time there were fifty subscribers at half a guinea each; the
receipts were given on the print of "Time Smoking a Picture." The
first name is that of Dr. Garnier, for two prints; the last, who also
subscribes for two prints, is Mr. Thomas Hollis. This gentleman
would not receive back the guinea he had paid, and it was given to a
public charity. Among the names are the late Philip Thicknesse,
Dr. Hunter, Samuel Curteis of Wapping, and David Garrick; against
each of the subscriptions is marked, "Money returned."
</p>
<p>
Under the direction of Hogarth, Mr. Basire made an etching from
"Sigismunda," but it was never finished. A drawing in oil was
made from it by Mr. Edwards, and it was a few years since engraved
in mezzotinto by Dunkerton. Mr. Ridley engraved it for Messrs.
Boydell, and a reduced copy is in the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51821/51821-h/51821-h.htm">first volume</a> of <cite>Hogarth Illustrated</cite>.</p></div>

poor "Sigismunda" into their political vortex, the cannibal caricaturists
of the day tore her in pieces as a carcase for the hounds, and
rioted over her mangled remains.
</p>
<p>
One of these political slaughtermen, in a print entitled "The Bruiser
Triumphant," describes Sigismunda in the character of a harlot
blubbering over a bullock's heart. In another, elegantly inscribed
"Tit for Tat," Hogarth is represented painting Wilkes' portrait,
and a bloated and filthy figure displayed in the background baptized
Sigismunda. Many other wretched and contemptible squibs were
hurled about on the same occasion. Besides this public abuse, some
of the anonymous versifiers of the day, who were not yet important
enough to figure in a newspaper or flutter in a magazine, condescended
to notice his political errors, and for the gratification of the artist
transmitted their effusions to Leicester Fields.

"'Tis true indeed, as the legendaries own, that St. Catherine was
slandered as a fond and light woman, and St. Teresa kept such bad
company, that most persons concluded celestial visions were not compatible
with her kind of life; but all this may be reconciled; for these
excesses of the spiritual and carnal affections are nearer allied than is
generally thought, arising from the same irregular emotions of the
blood and animal spirits; and the patient is hurried on either way,
according to the nature of the object; and I am much mistaken, and so
is history too, if some of the warmest and most enthusiastic pretenders to
the love of God have not entertained the same violence of passion (not
quite so spiritual) for their neighbours."&mdash;Lavington's <cite>Enthusiasm of

</p>
<p>
"Over a popish altar at Worms is a picture one would think invented
to ridicule transubstantiation. There is a windmill, and the
Virgin throws Christ into the hopper, and he comes out at the eye of
the mill all in wafers, which some priest takes up to give to the people.
This is so coarse an emblem, that one would think it was too gross even
for Laplanders; but a man that can swallow transubstantiation will
digest this likewise."

"First, the Genius of the place 'tells the waters,' or only simply
gives directions: then he 'helps the ambitious hill,' or is a fellow-labourer:
then again, he 'scoops the circling theatre,' or works alone,
or in chief. Afterwards, rising fast in our idea of dignity, he 'calls in
the country,' alluding to the orders of princes in their progress, when
accustomed to display all their state and magnificence. His character
then grows sacred, 'he joins willing woods,' a metaphor taken from
one of the offices of the priesthood, till at length he becomes a divinity,
and creates, and presides over the whole."&mdash;Warburton's edit. of <cite>Pope</cite>,

a sort of court, and several public tables, and a numerous body of

where he always received company, even at dinner, was the very same
room where he lodged; and his lady's sole apartment was her bedroom;

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;When genius is made subservient to public good, it does honour to the possessor,
as it is expressive of gratitude to his Creator, by exerting itself to further the
happiness of His creatures. The poignancy and delicacy of your ridicule has been
productive of more reformation than more elaborate pieces would have effected. On
the apprehension of opening the distillery, methinks I hear all good men cry, Fire!&mdash;it
is therefore the duty of every citizen to try to extinguish it. Rub up, then, Gin
Lane and Beer Street, that you may have the honour and advantage of bringing the
two first engines to the fire; and work them manfully at each corner of the building;
and instead of the paltry reward of thirty shillings allowed by Act of Parliament,
receive the glorious satisfaction of having extinguished those fierce flames which
threaten a general conflagration to human nature, by pouring liquid fire into the
veins of the now brave Britons, whose robust fabrics will soon fall in when these
dreadful flames have consumed the inside timbers and supporters.&mdash;I am, Sir,

<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
the text and consultation of external sources.</p>

<p>Footnotes have been moved to the end of the book text. Some Footnotes are very long.</p>

<p>One occurrence of the 3-star asterism symbol is denoted by ⁂. On
some handheld devices it may display as a space.</p>

<p>One occurrence of the old long-form s is denoted by ſ.</p>

<p>Footnotes [105] and [108] are referenced from the prior Footnotes
<a href="#Footnote_104_104">[104]</a> and <a href="#Footnote_107_107">[107]</a>, and not from the text itself.</p>

<p>Footnote <a href="#Footnote_55_55">[55]</a> is referenced by two anchors in the same paragraph.</p>

<p>For consistency and to follow the intent of the publisher, the Plate
illustrations have been moved to the beginning of the section
describing them. In most cases this was only one or two paragraphs
earlier than the original book layout.</p>

<p>Quotations of Hogarth himself, and all letters, have been indented
in the main text (but not the Addenda, Notes, or Footnotes). All
other quotations have not. The original text was not completely
consistent in its use of vertical whitespace to end letters and
Hogarth quotations.</p>

<p>Three illustrations listed in the <a href="#LOI">'List of Plates'</a> have no description
in the text, and have been placed after 'The Farmer's Return' section.
The three are:<br />
<span class="pad4">'Inhabitants of the Moon'</span><br />
<span class="pad4">'Receipt for Print of March to Finchley'</span><br />
<span class="pad4">'Gravity'.</span></p>

<p>The item numbering in the <a href="#CHRON">'Chronological List'</a> at the end of the book
is sometimes inconsistent or incorrect. This has been left unchanged.</p>

<p>Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text,
and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained. For example,
face-painter, face painter; Boleyne, Bulleyn; dissatisfactory;
confuting; unascertained; personate.</p>

<p>
<a href="#Page_vii">Pg vii</a>, '<span class="smcap">Martin Foulkes, Esq.</span>' replaced by '<span class="smcap">Martin Folkes, Esq.</span>'.<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
